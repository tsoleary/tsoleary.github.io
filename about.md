[CV](CV/tsoleary_cv_2019.pdf)

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Vermont in the [Lockwood Lab](https://lockwoodlab.weebly.com/). I received a B.A. in Biology from the University of Vermont in 2016. After graduation, I worked as a lab technician specializing in DNA and RNA sequencing for Charles River Labs in Philadelphia. I spent a year and a half as a research technician in the Previs Lab in the Dept. of Molecular Physiology at UVM, using proteomics to study the role of MyBP-C in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. For my graduate research, I am interested in understanding mechanisms of thermal adaptation at multiple levels of biological organization and across life stages.
