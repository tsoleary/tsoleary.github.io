# Running

## World Record Progression

<img src="https://tsoleary.github.io/fun/final_runner_fig.pdf" style="width:100%">

Andrea Allen, Mahalia Clark, Alison Hall, & I created a <a href="https://tsoleary.github.io/track/world_record_progression/athletics_world_record_progression.html" target="_blank">website</a> to visualize the progression of world records overtime.

# Data visualization and coding in R

I created a quick <a href="https://tsoleary.github.io/play/Lockwood_Lab/tidyverse_intro.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a> for my lab mates to learn the tidyverse.

## Shiny apps

Below are a couple of examples of quick and fun shiny apps I created.

### Baseball historic data

# Biology Social Committee

## Gratitude in Science

As part of the Biology Social Committee's initiative to foster an inclusive atmosphere within the UVM Biology Department, we had faculty, students, and staff submit the reasons they had to be thankful in November 2020 — and we used those responses to create a real and virtual Gratitude Tree.

Thanksgiving is traditionally a time to take a step back from the day-to-day grind and take a mental inventory of the things for which we are grateful: our family, friends, colleagues, homes, & health. This is especially important in a brutal year like this one – we still have so much to be thankful for.

This activity is an opportunity for us to reflect collectively as a department. Success in science, as in life, is rarely, if ever, individual. Success depends on entire networks of people who work together to support us. They may lend us an ear, offer advice, or teach us something new! Showing gratitude in science is a powerful way to recognize the importance of this support network and also actively build and maintain that network. Thinking about the ways we have been supported in the past can also show us how we can give back!
