[CV](CV/tsoleary_cv_2022.pdf)

I am a PhD student in the  [Lockwood Lab](https://lockwoodlab.weebly.com/) at the University of Vermont. I am currently studying molecular mechanisms of heat adaptation in _Drosophila melanogaster_, with an emphasis on early embryonic development and the maintenance of redox homeostasis.

I received a B.A. in Biology from the University of Vermont in 2016. After graduation, I worked as a lab technician specializing in DNA and RNA sequencing for Charles River Labs in Philadelphia. I spent a year and a half as a research technician in the Previs Lab in the Dept. of Molecular Physiology at UVM, using proteomics to study the role of MyBP-C in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
