## Multi-strain vaccine selection on a genotype network

We used an evolutionary algorithm on an _Influenza A_ genotype network to determine the best strains to select for vaccination. A first draft of the paper can be found <a href = "projects/Vaccine_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Open source code can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/tsoleary/vaccines" target="_blank">GitHub</a>


## Balancing selection

We created a model to attempt to better understand the mechanisms that give rise to balancing selection in the context of seasonal adaptation in _Drosophila melanogaster_. A rough draft of our manuscript can be found <a href = "projects/season_adapt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Open source code for the model can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/tsoleary/season_adapt" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
