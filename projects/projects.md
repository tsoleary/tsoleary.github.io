## Frontiers in Genetics

This project aimed to connect the genetic architecture of thermal tolerance in _Drosophila melanogaster_ with gene expression under thermal stress as part of collaborative grant – more information on the grant can be found <a href = "https://www.thermofly.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.

This work resulted in a publication in _Frontiers in Genetics_ titled "Integrating GWAS and transcriptomics to identify the molecular underpinnings of thermal stress responses in _Drosophila melanogaster_." Check it out <a href="publications/lecheta_et_al_2020.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.

## Multi-strain vaccine selection on a genotype network

We used an evolutionary algorithm on an _Influenza A_ genotype network to determine the best strains to select for vaccination. A first draft of the paper can be found <a href = "projects/Vaccine_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Open source code can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/tsoleary/vaccines" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.


## Balancing selection

We created a model to attempt to better understand the mechanisms that give rise to balancing selection in the context of seasonal adaptation in _Drosophila melanogaster_. A rough draft of our manuscript can be found <a href = "projects/season_adapt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Open source code for the model can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/tsoleary/season_adapt" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
