This project aimed to connect the genetic architecture of thermal tolerance in _Drosophila melanogaster_ with gene expression under thermal stress. This work was part of multi-institutional collaborative grant â€“ more information on the grant can be found <a href = "https://www.thermofly.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. Check out the paper in _Frontiers in Genetics_ <a href="publications/lecheta_et_al_2020.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease of the heart where the muscle in the ventricle becomes so large that it obstructs the flow of blood. Truncation mutations within the gene _MYBPC3_, which encodes the protein cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), are a frequent cause of HCM. This research found that these mutations led to reduced cMyBP-C content in the heart muscle of HCM patients. And that decrease in cMyBP-C content corresponded with _in vivo_ increases the sliding velocity of the thin filament across the C-zone of the thick filament.

## Sarcomeric protein turnover

More recent work has investigated the relative turnover rates of sarcomeric proteins _in vivo_ with mice fed a diet of heavy isotope labeling of an amino acid (D3-Leu).

## Multi-strain vaccine selection on a genotype network

<img src="https://tsoleary.github.io/projects_page/flu_net.png" style="width:75%">

Current strategies to choose strains of a virus for a vaccine involve models of forecasted prevalence without regard to the underlying genotype network of the virus itself.

We used an evolutionary algorithm on an _Influenza A_ genotype network to determine the best strains to select for vaccination. A draft of the paper can be found <a href = "projects_page/Vaccine_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Open source code can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/tsoleary/vaccines" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

## Balancing selection

What sort of mechanisms maintain polymorphism within a population? Previous work has shown that seasonal changes in the dominance of an allele can stably maintain polymorphism within a population (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1702994114" target="_blank">Wittmann et al. 2017</a>). We created a similar model to explore the role genetic linkage may play in maintaining polymorphism in this context. A rough draft of our results can be found <a href = "projects_page/season_adapt.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Open source code for the model can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/tsoleary/season_adapt" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
