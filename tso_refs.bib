abstract = {A basic task in the analysis of count data from RNA-Seq is the detection of differentially expressed genes. The count data are presented as a table which reports, for each sample, the number of sequence fragments that have been assigned to each gene. Analogous data also arise for other assay types, including comparative ChIP-Seq, HiC, shRNA screening, mass spectrometry. An important analysis question is the quantification and statistical inference of systematic changes between conditions, as compared to within-condition variability. The package DESeq2 provides methods to test for differential expression by use of negative binomial generalized linear models; the estimates of dispersion and logarithmic fold changes incorporate data-driven prior distributions 1. This vignette explains the use of the package and demonstrates typical work flows. Another vignette, “Beginner's guide to using the DESeq2 package”, covers similar material but at a slower pace, including the generation of count tables from FASTQ file},

This process allows for the elucidation of differentially expressed genes across two or more conditions and is widely used in many applications of RNA-seq data analysis. Interpretation of the DGE results can be nonintuitive and time consuming due to the variety of formats based on the tool of choice and the numerous pieces of information provided in these results files. Here we reviewed DGE results analysis from a functional point of view for various visualizations. We also provide an R/Bioconductor package, Visualization of Differential Gene Expression Results using R, which generates information-rich visualizations for the interpretation of DGE results from three widely used tools, Cuffdiff, DESeq2 and edgeR. The implemented functions are also tested on five real-world data sets, consisting of one human, one Malus domestica and three Vitis riparia data sets.},

This paper examines a bivariate regression problem and demonstrates that operator equalisation suffers from bloat like behaviour when attempting to solve this problem. This is in contrast to a spatial co-evolutionary mechanism (SCALP) that appears to avoid bloat, without any need for express bloat control mechanisms. A previously analysed real world problem (human oral bioavailability prediction) is examined. The behaviour of SCALP on this problem is quite different from that of standard GP and operator equalisation leading to short, general candidate solutions. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {In this report, we examine the hypothesis that the drivers of latitudinal selection observed in the eastern US Drosophila melanogaster populations are reiterated within seasons in a temperate orchard population in Pennsylvania, USA. Specifically, we ask whether alleles that are apparently favoured in northern populations are also favoured early in the spring, and decrease in frequency from the spring to autumn with the population expansion. We use SNP data collected for 46 metabolic genes and 128 SNPs representing the central metabolic pathway and examine for the aggregate SNP allele frequencies whether the association of allele change with latitude and that with increasing days of spring-autumn season are reversed. Testing by random permutation, we observe a highly significant negative correlation between these associations that is consistent with this expectation. This correlation is stronger when we confine our analysis to only those alleles that show significant latitudinal changes. This pattern is not caused by association with chromosomal inversions. When data are resampled using SNPs for amino acid change the relationship is not significant but is supported when SNPs associated with cis-expression are only considered. Our results suggest that climate factors driving latitudinal molecular variation in a metabolic pathway are related to those operating on a seasonal level within populations.},

@article{Gu2009,
abstract = {Thermal adaptation of individual proteins is often achieved through modulating protein stability, with proteins that are adapted to extreme cold environments having increased conformational flexibility when brought to mesophilic conditions. Conversely, proteins adapted to higher temperatures appear less dynamic and are found to be much more stable against thermal denaturation than their mesophilic counterparts. According to the current paradigm, the adaptation of an organism for survival at higher or lower temperatures is facilitated by the adaptation of the component proteins. We note, however, that these observations have been carried out on relatively few proteins. The extent to which the conformational stabilities of all members of the proteome have been modulated for thermal adaptation remains unclear, with no direct experimental strategies to address this issue. Adapted extremophilies are likely to use a multitude of molecular and biophysical strategies for survival and, therefore, evolution of specific biophysical properties of proteins for optimal function may not be necessary for all proteins in the proteome. Using a sequence-based predictor of protein stability, eScape, an in silico examination of several extremophilic proteomes shows a correlation between the collective stability of the proteins and the thermal range of survival for the organism as expected. Unexpectedly, however, the analysis shows that protein thermostability is modified to different extents across the proteome and depends on the functional role for which the protein is involved. Identification of these differences provides unique opportunities to study interdependence within the proteome as well as the role that the proteome plays in the process of evolutionary thermal adaptation.},

abstract = {The characterization of the distribution of mutational effects is a key goal in evolutionary biology. Recently developed deep-sequencing approaches allow for accurate and simultaneous estimation of the fitness effects of hundreds of engineered mutations by monitoring their relative abundance across time points in a single bulk competition. Naturally, the achievable resolution of the estimated fitness effects depends on the specific experimental setup, the organism and type of mutations studied, the sequencing technology utilized, among other factors. By means of analytical approximations and simulations, we provide guidelines for optimizing time-sampled deep-sequencing bulk competition experiments, focusing on the number of mutants, the sequencing depth, and the number of sampled time points. Our analytical results show that sampling more time points together with extending the duration of the experiment improves the achievable precision disproportionately as compared with increasing the sequencing depth, or reducing the number of competing mutants. Even if the duration of the experiment is fixed, sampling more time points and clustering these at the beginning and the end of the experiment increases experimental power, and allows the efficient and precise assessment of the entire range of selection coefficients. Finally, we provide a formula for calculating the 95{\%}-confidence interval for the measurement error estimate, which we implement as an interactive web tool. This allows for quantification of the maximum expected a priori precision of the experimental setup, as well as for a statistical threshold for determining deviations from neutrality for specific selection coefficient estimates.},

Epigenetic information is passed across cell divisions through the methylation of DNA, the modification of histone proteins, and the activity of noncoding RNAs. Much of our knowledge of insect epigenetics has been gleaned from a few model species. However, more studies of epigenetic information in traditionally nonmodel taxa will help advance our understanding of the developmental and evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance in insects. To this end, we also provide a brief overview of techniques for profiling and perturbing individual facets of the epigenome.

abstract = {Bee poisoning, the accidental killing of bees through the use of insecticides, first became a problem in the United States during the l870s. The problems remained restricted and localiz.ed until the surge in modern agricultural methods following World War II. Highly effective synthetic organic insecticides became feasible for use not only on all types of crops but also on tremendous acreages of rangelands and forests. Development of efficient herbicides led to severe reduction in bee forage plants on both cultivated and wild lands. This not only involves direct removal, such as elimination of sweetclover from wheat fields, but also treatments which cause displacement of bee plants by herbicide-tolerant, non-bee plants, such as dalmatian toad flax, yarrow, and nightshade. There can also be a conf l ict noxious weeds-e. g. yellow starthistle, Russian knapweed, hounds-tongue, and Canada thistle-are excellent pollen and nectar sources. Ever-increasing monocul­ tures of crops and the associated removal of fencerows and wild strips have reduced both bee forage and nest sites for wild bees. These developments have caused greater dependency upon honey bees for pollination of crops and simultaneously forced beekeepers to pasture their bees on insecticide-treated fields. Increasing the acreages of crops has a definite effect on pollination re quirements. Wild bees and hobbyist colonies of honey bees normally provide for good yields on 10 acres of raspberries, but a grower with SO acres usually re quires pollination service from a beekeeper. Development of hybrid varieties often increases the need for pollination. Hybrid onion and hybrid cabbage seed production pose special problems in transferring pollen from male-fertile rows to male-sterile rows or from compatible pollen rows to self-incompatible rows. Intensive plantings of dwarf fruit trees normally re quire two colonies of honey bees per acre, compared to one per acre in standard orchards. Many trends in modern agriculture have led to a vicious circle ISurvey of the literature pertaining to this review mainly covers the period 1967 to 1975 and follows the comprehensive article by Anderson {\&} Atkins (2).},

This difference has evolved by the accumulation of neutral mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.},

abstract = { The influence of population size ( N ) on natural selection acting on alleles that affect fitness has been understood for almost a century. As N declines, genetic drift overwhelms selection and alleles with direct fitness effects are rendered neutral. Often, however, alleles experience so-called indirect selection, meaning they affect not the fitness of an individual but the fitness distribution of its offspring. Some of the best-studied examples of indirect selection include alleles that modify aspects of the genetic system such as recombination and mutation rates. Here, we use analytics, simulations, and experimental populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine the influence of N on indirect selection acting on alleles that increase the genomic mutation rate (mutators). Mutators experience indirect selection via genomic associations with beneficial and deleterious mutations they generate. We show that, as N declines, indirect selection driven by linked beneficial mutations is overpowered by drift before drift can neutralize the cost of the deleterious load. As a result, mutators transition from being favored by indirect selection in large populations to being disfavored as N declines. This surprising phenomenon of sign inversion in selective effect demonstrates that indirect selection on mutators exhibits a profound and qualitatively distinct dependence on N . },

abstract = {Proposes a TD (temporal difference) and GA (genetic algorithm) based reinforcement (TDGAR) neural learning scheme for controlling chaotic dynamical systems based on the technique of small perturbations. The TDGAR learning scheme is a new hybrid GA, which integrates the TD prediction method and the GA to fulfil the reinforcement learning task. Structurally, the TDGAR learning system is composed of two integrated feedforward networks. One neural network acts as a critic network for helping the learning of the other network, the action network, which determines the outputs (actions) of the TDGAR learning system. Using the TD prediction method, the critic network can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the action network. The action network uses the GA to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal. This can usually accelerate the GA learning since an external reinforcement signal may only be available at a time long after a sequence of actions have occurred in the reinforcement learning problems. By defining a simple external reinforcement signal. the TDGAR learning system can learn to produce a series of small perturbations to convert chaotic oscillations of a chaotic system into desired regular ones with a periodic behavior. The proposed method is an adaptive search for the optimum control technique. Computer simulations on controlling two chaotic systems, i.e., the Henon map and the logistic map, have been conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

abstract = {As organisms age the environment fluctuates, exerting differential selection across ontogeny. In particular, highly seasonal environments expose life stages to often drastically different thermal environments. This developmental variation is particularly striking in organisms with complex life cycles, wherein life history stages also exhibit distinct morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors. Genes acting pleiotropically on thermal responses may produce genetic correlations across ontogeny, constraining the independent evolution of each life stage to their respective thermal environments. To investigate whether developmental genetic correlations constrain the evolution thermal hardiness of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, we applied quantitative genetic analyses to cold hardiness measured in both larvae and adults from isogenic lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), using survival at stressful low temperatures as the phenotypic metric. Using full genome resequencing data for the DGRP, we also implemented genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models (BSLMMs) to estimate associations between naturally segregating variation and cold hardiness for both larvae and adults. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed no significant genetic correlation for cold hardiness between life stages, suggesting complete genetic decoupling of thermal hardiness across the metamorphic boundary. Both quantitative genetic and GWA analyses suggested that polygenic variation underlies cold hardiness in both stages, and that associated loci largely affected one stage or the other, but not both. However, reciprocal enrichment tests and correlations between BSLMM parameters for each life stage support some shared physiological mechanisms that may reflect common cellular thermal response pathways. Overall, these results suggest no developmental genetic constraints on cold hardiness across metamorphosis in D. melanogaster, an important consideration in evolutionary models of responses to changing climates. Genetic correlations for environmental sensitivity across ontogeny remains largely unexplored in other organisms, thus assessing the generality of genetic decoupling will require further quantitative or population genetic analysis in additional species.},

Here, I analyse a genotype network comprising hundreds of influenza A (H3N2) haemagglutinin genes. The network is rife with cycles that reflect non-random parallel or convergent (homoplastic) evolution. These cycles also show patterns of sequence change characteristic for strong and local evolutionary constraints, positive selection and mutation-limited evolution. Such cycles would not be visible on a phylogenetic tree, illustrating that genotype network analysis can complement phylogenetic analyses. The network also shows a distinct modular or community structure that reflects temporal more than spatial proximity of viral strains, where lowly connected bridge strains connect different modules.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 American Heart Association, Inc. Background: Heterozygous mutations in sarcomere genes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are proposed to exert their effect through gain of function for missense mutations or loss of function for truncating mutations. However, allelic expression from individual mutations has not been sufficiently characterized to support this exclusive distinction in human HCM. Methods and Results: Sarcomere transcript and protein levels were analyzed in septal myectomy and transplant specimens from 46 genotyped HCM patients with or without sarcomere gene mutations and 10 control hearts. For truncating mutations in MYBPC3, the average ratio of mutant:wild-type transcripts was ≈1:5, in contrast to ≈1:1 for all sarcomere missense mutations, confirming that nonsense transcripts are uniquely unstable. However, total MYBPC3 mRNA was significantly increased by 9-fold in HCM samples with MYBPC3 mutations compared with control hearts and with HCM samples without sarcomere gene mutations. Full-length MYBPC3 protein content was not different between MYBPC3 mutant HCM and control samples, and no truncated proteins were detected. By absolute quantification of abundance with multiple reaction monitoring, stoichiometric ratios of mutant sarcomere proteins relative to wild type were strikingly variable in a mutation-specific manner, with the fraction of mutant protein ranging from 30{\%} to 84{\%}. Conclusions: These results challenge the concept that haploinsufficiency is a unifying mechanism for HCM caused by MYBPC3 truncating mutations. The range of allelic imbalance for several missense sarcomere mutations suggests that certain mutant proteins may be more or less stable or incorporate more or less efficiently into the sarcomere than wildtype proteins. These mutation-specific properties may distinctly influence disease phenotypes.},

abstract = {Orthologous proteins of species adapted to different temperatures exhibit differences in stability and function that are interpreted to reflect adaptive variation in structural “flexibility.” However, quantifying flexibility and comparing flexibility across proteins has remained a challenge. To address this issue, we examined temperature effects on cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) orthologs from differently thermally adapted congeners of five genera of marine molluscs whose field body temperatures span a range of ∼60 °C. We describe consistent patterns of convergent evolution in adaptation of function [temperature effects on K M of cofactor (NADH)] and structural stability (rate of heat denaturation of activity). To determine how these differences depend on flexibilities of overall structure and of regions known to be important in binding and catalysis, we performed molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analyses. MDS analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between adaptation temperature and heat-induced increase of backbone atom movements [root mean square deviation (rmsd) of main-chain atoms]. Root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) of movement by individual amino acid residues varied across the sequence in a qualitatively similar pattern among orthologs. Regions of sequence involved in ligand binding and catalysis—termed mobile regions 1 and 2 (MR1 and MR2), respectively—showed the largest values for RMSF. Heat-induced changes in RMSF values across the sequence and, importantly, in MR1 and MR2 were greatest in cold-adapted species. MDS methods are shown to provide powerful tools for examining adaptation of enzymes by providing a quantitative index of protein flexibility and identifying sequence regions where adaptive change in flexibility occurs.},

CONCLUSIONS Predominance of A(H3N2) clade 3C.3a viruses during the latter part of the 2018-2019 season was associated with decreased vaccine effectiveness, supporting the A(H3N2) vaccine component update for 2019-2020 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.},

We characterized the levels of cellular plasticity during development in populations of Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved for over three years in either constant or temporally variable thermal environments.We used twomeasures of the lipid composition of cell membranes as indices of physiological plasticity (a.k.a. acclimation): (1) change in the ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) and (2) change in lipid saturation (number of double bonds) in cool (16C) relative to warm (25C) developmental conditions. Flies evolved under variable environments had a greater capacity to acclimate the PE/PC ratio compared to flies evolved in constant environments, supporting the prediction that environments with high among-generation variance favor greater developmental plasticity. Our results are consistent with the selective advantage of a more environmentally sensitive allele that may have associated costs in constant environments.},

abstract = {Many wildlife populations are either naturally, or as a result of human land use, patchily distributed in space. The degree of fragmentation—specifically the remaining patch sizes and habitat configuration—is an important part of population dynamics. Demographic stochasticity is also likely to play an important role in patchy habitats that host small local populations. We develop a simulation model to evaluate the significance of demographic stochasticity and the role fragmentation plays in the determination of population dynamics and the risk of extinction of populations on habitat patches. Our model is formulated as a Markov-chain stochastic process on a finite, spatially explicit array of patches in which probability of successful dispersal is a function of interpatch distance. Unlike past work, we explicitly model local population dynamics and examine how these scale up to the entire population. As a test case, we apply the model to the American pika (Ochotona princeps) population living on the ore dumps in the ghost mining town of Bodie, California. This population has been studied nearly continuously for over four decades and has been of conservation concern as the southern half of the population declined precipitously beginning in 1989. Our model suggests that both the specific configuration of habitat and landscape heterogeneity are necessary and sufficient predictors of the eventual extinction of the southern constellation of patches. This example has important implications, as it suggests that fragmentation alone can lead to regional extinctions within metapopulations.},

abstract = {In variable environments, selection should favor generalists that maintain fitness across a range of conditions. However, costs of adaptation may generate fitness trade-offs and lead to some compromise between specialization and generalization that maximizes fitness. Here, we evaluate the evolution of specialization and generalization in 20 populations of Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved in constant and variable thermal environments for 3 years. We developed genotypes from each population at two temperatures after which we measured fecundity across eight temperatures. We predicted that constant environments would select for thermal specialists and that variable environments would select for thermal generalists. Contrary to our predictions, specialists and generalists did not evolve in constant and spatially variable environments, respectively. However, temporal variation produced a type of generalist that has rarely been considered by theoretical models of developmental plasticity. Specifically, genotypes from the temporally variable selective environment were more fecund across all temperatures than were genotypes from other environments. These patterns suggest certain allelic effects and should inspire new directions for modeling adaptation to fluctuating environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

Along with a large number of successful applications, many different variants of novelty search have been proposed. It is still unclear, however, how some key parameters and algorithmic components influence the evolutionary dynamics and performance of novelty search. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study focused on novelty search's algorithmic components. We study the k parameter - the number of nearest neighbours used in the computation of novelty scores; the use and function of an archive; how to combine novelty search with fitness-based evolution; and how to configure the mutation rate of the underlying evolutionary algorithm. Our study is conducted in a simulated maze navigation task. Our results show that the configuration of novelty search can have a significant impact on performance and behaviour space exploration. We conclude with a number of guidelines for the implementation and configuration of novelty search, which should help future practitioners to apply novelty search more effectively.},

abstract = {Populations arrayed along broad latitudinal gradients often show patterns of clinal variation in phenotype and genotype. Such population differentiation can be generated and maintained by both historical demographic events and local adaptation. These evolutionary forces are not mutually exclusive and can in some cases produce nearly identical patterns of genetic differentiation among populations. Here, we investigate the evolutionary forces that generated and maintain clinal variation genome-wide among populations of Drosophila melanogaster sampled in North America and Australia. We contrast patterns of clinal variation in these continents with patterns of differentiation among ancestral European and African populations. Using established and novel methods we derive here, we show that recently derived North America and Australia populations were likely founded by both European and African lineages and that this hybridization event likely contributed to genome-wide patterns of parallel clinal variation between continents. The pervasive effects of admixture mean that differentiation at only several hundred loci can be attributed to the operation of spatially varying selection using an FST outlier approach. Our results provide novel insight into the well-studied system of clinal differentiation in D. melanogaster and provide a context for future studies seeking to identify loci contributing to local adaptation in a wide variety of organisms, including other invasive species as well as temperate endemics.},

In this study the molecular basis of resistance to the organophosphate insecticide azinphos-methyl was investigated using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel and genome-wide association. Recently released full transcriptome data was used to extend the utility of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel resource beyond traditional genomewide association studies to allow systems genetics analyses of phenotypes. We found that both genomic and transcriptomic associations independently identified Cyp6g1, a gene involved in resistance to DDT and neonicotinoid insecticides, as the top candidate for azinphos-methyl resistance. This was verified by transgenically overexpressing Cyp6g1 using natural regulatory elements from a resistant allele, resulting in a 6.5-fold increase in resistance. We also identified four novel candidate genes associated with azinphos-methyl resistance, all of which are involved in either regulation of fat storage or nervous system development. In Cyp6g1, we find a demonstrable resistance locus, a verification that transcriptome data can be used to identify variants associated with insecticide resistance, and an overlap between peaks of a genome-wide association study and a genome-wide selective sweep analysis.},

Genic variance was estimated using offspring-parent regressions, full-sib, and half-sib covariances, with quite consistent results. Expressed genic variance between male progeny was always higher than that among female progeny.-The pairs of estimates obtained were as follows: female heritabilities first, 0.40 +/- 0.09 and 0.84 +/- 0.35 (half-sibs); 0.20 +/- 0.09 and 0.79 +/- 0.24 (full-sibs); 0.11 +/- 0.10 and 0.89 +/- 0.45 (full-sibs); 0.28 +/- 0.18 and 0.78 +/- 0.29 (full-sibs); 0.11 +/- 0.44 and 0.72 +/- 0.26 (offspring-parent regression).

abstract = {Background.Influenza vaccines may be reformulated annually because of antigenic drift in influenza viruses. However, the relationship between antigenic characteristics of circulating viruses and vaccine effectiveness (VE) is not well understood. We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of US influenza vaccines during the 2010-2011 season.Methods.We performed a case-control study comparing vaccination histories between subjects with acute respiratory illness with positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza and influenza test-negative controls. Subjects with acute respiratory illness of ≤7 days duration were enrolled in hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics in communities in 4 states. History of immunization with the 2010-2011 vaccine was ascertained from vaccine registries or medical records. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated in logistic regression models adjusted for study community, age, race, insurance status, enrollment site, and presence of a high-risk medical condition.Results.A total of 1040 influenza-positive cases and 3717 influenza-negative controls were included from the influenza season, including 373 cases of influenza A(H1N1), 334 cases of influenza A(H3N2), and 333 cases of influenza B. Overall adjusted VE was 60 (95 confidence interval [CI], 53-66). Age-specific VE estimates ranged from 69 (95 CI, 56-77) in children aged 6 months-8 years to 38 (95 CI, -16 to 67) in adults aged ≥65 years.Conclusions.The US 2010-2011 influenza vaccines were moderately effective in preventing medically attended influenza during a season when all 3 vaccine strains were antigenically similar to circulating viruses. Continued monitoring of influenza vaccines in all age groups is important, particularly as new vaccines are introduced. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {* Changes in temperature disrupt the fluidity of cellular membranes, which can negatively impact membrane integrity and cellular processes. Many ectotherms, including Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen), adjust the glycerophospholipid composition of their membranes to restore optimal fluidity when temperatures change, a type of trait plasticity termed homeoviscous adaptation. * Existing data suggest that plasticity in the relative abundances of the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) underlies cellular adaptation to temporal variability in the thermal environment. For example, laboratory populations of D. melanogaster evolved in the presence of temporally variable temperatures have greater developmental plasticity of the ratio of PE to PC (PE/PC) and greater fecundity than do populations evolved at constant temperatures. * Here, we extend this work to natural populations of D. melanogaster by evaluating thermal plasticity of glycerophospholipid composition at different life stages, in genotypes isolated from Vermont, Indiana and North Carolina, USA. We also quantify the covariance between developmental and adult (reversible) plasticity, and between adult responses of the membrane to cool and warm thermal shifts. * As predicted by physiological models of homeoviscous adaptation, flies from all populations decrease PE/PC and the degree of lipid unsaturation in response to warm temperatures. Furthermore, these populations have diverged in their degree of membrane plasticity. Flies from the most variable thermal environment (Vermont, USA) decrease PE/PC to a greater extent than do other populations when developed at a warm temperature, a pattern that matches our previous observation in laboratory-evolved populations. We also find that developmental plasticity and adult plasticity of PE/PC covary across genotypes, but that adult responses to cool and warm thermal shifts do not. * When combined with our previous observations of laboratory-evolved populations, our findings implicate developmental plasticity of PE/PC as a mechanism of thermal adaptation in temporally variable environments. While little is known about the genetic bases of plastic responses to temperature, our observations suggest that both environmentally sensitive and environmentally specific alleles contribute to thermal adaptation of membranes and that costs of plasticity may arise when the adult environment differs from that experienced during development.},

abstract = { In eukaryotes, the heterohexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) coordinates replication onset by facilitating the recruitment and loading of the minichromosome maintenance 2–7 (Mcm2–7) replicative helicase onto DNA to license origins. Drosophila ORC can adopt an autoinhibited configuration that is predicted to prevent Mcm2–7 loading; how the complex is activated and whether other ORC homologs can assume this state are not known. Using chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, biochemical assays, and electron microscopy (EM), we show that the autoinhibited state of Drosophila ORC is populated in solution, and that human ORC can also adopt this form. ATP binding to ORC supports a transition from the autoinhibited state to an active configuration, enabling the nucleotide-dependent association of ORC with both DNA and Cdc6. An unstructured N-terminal region adjacent to the conserved ATPase domain of Orc1 is shown to be required for high-affinity ORC–DNA interactions, but not for activation. ORC optimally binds DNA duplexes longer than the predicted footprint of the ORC ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities (AAA + ) and winged-helix (WH) folds; cryo-EM analysis of Drosophila ORC bound to DNA and Cdc6 indicates that ORC contacts DNA outside of its central core region, bending the DNA away from its central DNA-binding channel. Our findings indicate that ORC autoinhibition may be common to metazoans and that ORC–Cdc6 remodels origin DNA before Mcm2–7 recruitment and loading. },

abstract = {Human influenza virus rapidly accumulates mutations in its major surface protein hemagglutinin (HA). The evolutionary success of influenza virus lineages depends on how these mutations affect HA's functionality and antigenicity. Here we experimentally measure the effects on viral growth in cell culture of all single amino acid mutations to the HA from a recent human H3N2 influenza virus strain. We show that mutations that are measured to be more favorable for viral growth are enriched in evolutionarily successful H3N2 viral lineages relative to mutations that are measured to be less favorable for viral growth. Therefore, despite the well-known caveats about cell-culture measurements of viral fitness, such measurements can still be informative for understanding evolution in nature. We also compare our measurements for H3 HA to similar data previously generated for a distantly related H1 HA and find substantial differences in which amino acids are preferred at many sites. For instance, the H3 HA has less disparity in mutational tolerance between the head and stalk domains than the H1 HA. Overall, our work suggests that experimental measurements of mutational effects can be leveraged to help understand the evolutionary fates of viral lineages in nature—but only when the measurements are made on a viral strain similar to the ones being studied in nature.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. Examples of clinal variation in phenotypes and genotypes across latitudinal transects have served as important models for understanding how spatially varying selection and demographic forces shape variation within species. Here, we examine the selective and demographic contributions to latitudinal variation through the largest comparative genomic study to date of Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster, with genomic sequence data from 382 individual fruit flies, collected across a spatial transect of 19 degrees latitude and at multiple time points over 2 years. Consistent with phenotypic studies, we find less clinal variation in D. simulans than D. melanogaster, particularly for the autosomes. Moreover, we find that clinally varying loci in D. simulans are less stable over multiple years than comparable clines in D. melanogaster. D. simulans shows a significantly weaker pattern of isolation by distance than D. melanogaster and we find evidence for a stronger contribution of migration to D. simulans population genetic structure. While population bottlenecks and migration can plausibly explain the differences in stability of clinal variation between the two species, we also observe a significant enrichment of shared clinal genes, suggesting that the selective forces associated with climate are acting on the same genes and phenotypes in D. simulans and D. melanogaster.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a genetic programming approach to learning stochastic models with unsymmetrical noise distributions. Most learning algorithms try to learn from noisy data by modeling the maximum likelihood output or least squared error, assuming that noise effects average out. While this process works well for data with symmetrical noise distributions (such as Gaussian observation noise), many real-life sources of noise are not symmetrically distributed, thus this approach does not hold. We suggest improved learning can be obtained by including noise sources explicitly in the model as a stochastic element. A stochastic element is a random sub-process or latent variable of a hidden system that can propagate nonlinear noise to the observable outputs. Stochastic elements can skew and distort output features making regression of analytical models particularly difficult and error minimizing approaches inhibiting. We introduce a new method to infer the analytical model of a system by decomposing non-uniform noise observed at the outputs into uniform stochastic elements appearing symbolically inside the system. Results demonstrate the ability to regress exact analytical models where stochastic elements are embedded inside nonlinear and polynomial hidden systems. Copyright 2007 ACM.},

abstract = {The characterization of the distribution of mutational effects is a key goal in evolutionary biology. Recently developed deep-sequencing approaches allow for accurate and simultaneous estimation of the fitness effects of hundreds of engineered mutations by monitoring their relative abundance across time points in a single bulk competition. Naturally, the achievable resolution of the estimated fitness effects depends on the specific experimental setup, the organism and type of mutations studied, the sequencing technology utilized, among other factors. By means of analytical approximations and simulations, we provide guidelines for optimizing time-sampled deep-sequencing bulk competition experiments, focusing on the number of mutants, the sequencing depth, and the number of sampled time points. Our analytical results show that sampling more time points together with extending the duration of the experiment improves the achievable precision disproportionately as compared with increasing the sequencing depth, or reducing the number of competing mutants. Even if the duration of the experiment is fixed, sampling more time points and clustering these at the beginning and the end of the experiment increases experimental power, and allows the efficient and precise assessment of the entire range of selection coefficients. Finally, we provide a formula for calculating the 95{\%}-confidence interval for the measurement error estimate, which we implement as an interactive web tool. This allows for quantification of the maximum expected a priori precision of the experimental setup, as well as for a statistical threshold for determining deviations from neutrality for specific selection coefficient estimates.},

abstract = {Hybridization has become a central element in theories of animal evolution during the last decade. New methods in population genomics and statistical model testing now allow the disentangling of the complexity that hybridization brings into key evolutionary processes such as local adaptation, colonization of new environments, species diversification and extinction. We evaluated the consequences of hybridization in a complex of three alpine butterflies in the genus Coenonympha, by combining morphological, genetic and ecological analyses. A series of approximate Bayesian computation procedures based on a large SNP data set strongly suggest that the Darwin's Heath (Coenonympha darwiniana) originated through hybridization between the Pearly Heath (Coenonympha arcania) and the Alpine Heath (Coenonympha gardetta) with different parental contributions. As a result of hybridization, the Darwin's Heath presents an intermediate morphology between the parental species, while its climatic niche seems more similar to the Alpine Heath. Our results also reveal a substantial genetic and morphologic differentiation between the two geographically disjoint Darwin's Heath lineages leading us to propose the splitting of this taxon into two different species.},

abstract = {Spontaneous mutations are the source of genetic variation required for evolutionary change, and are therefore important for many aspects of evolutionary biology. For example, the divergence between taxa at neutrally evolving sites in the genome is proportional to the per nucleotide mutation rate, u (ref. 1), and this can be used to date speciation events by assuming a molecular clock. The overall rate of occurrence of deleterious mutations in the genome each generation (U) appears in theories of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism, the evolution of sex and recombination, and the evolutionary consequences of inbreeding. However, estimates of U based on changes in allozymes or DNA sequences and fitness traits are discordant. Here we directly estimate u in Drosophila melanogaster by scanning 20 million bases of DNA from three sets of mutation accumulation lines by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. From 37 mutation events that we detected, we obtained a mean estimate for u of 8.4 × 10-9 per generation. Moreover, we detected significant heterogeneity in u among the three mutation-accumulation- line genotypes. By multiplying u by an estimate of the fraction of mutations that are deleterious in natural populations of Drosophila, we estimate that U is 1.2 per diploid genome. This high rate suggests that selection against deleterious mutations may have a key role in explaining patterns of genetic variation in the genome, and help to maintain recombination and sexual reproduction. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

Population projections are used to examine the sen- sitivity of Frazer's life table to variations in parameter estimates as well as the likely response of the population to various management alternatives.

In oviparous animals whose embryos are exposed to the external environment, maternal provisioning of molecular factors like mRNAs and proteins may help embryos cope with sudden changes in the environment. Here we sought to modify the maternal mRNA contribution to offspring embryos and test for maternal effects on acute thermal tolerance in early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. We drove in vivo overexpression of a small heat shock protein gene (Hsp23) in female ovaries and measured the effects of acute thermal stress on offspring embryonic survival and larval development. We report that overexpression of the Hsp23 gene in female ovaries produced offspring embryos with increased thermal tolerance. We also found that brief heat stress in the early embryonic stage (0 to 1 hour-old) caused decreased larval performance later in life (5 to 10 days-old), as indexed by pupation height, as well as increased development time to pupation. Maternal overexpression of Hsp23 protected embryos against these heat-induced larval defects. Our data demonstrate that transient products of single genes have large and lasting effects on whole-organism environmental tolerance. Further, our results suggest that maternal effects have a profound impact on offspring survival in the context of thermal variability.},

abstract = {Insects can adapt to temperate environments by increasing levels of resistance to cold conditions over winter and/or altering reproductive patterns to focus reproduction in favourable conditions. In temperate areas, Drosophila melanogaster persists over winter at the adult stage. A previous experiment, conducted with flies kept in outdoor population cages in the temperate winter, indicated that temperate populations produced more eggs than did tropical populations following an abrupt increase in reproduction in late winter. In contrast, the tropical populations produced more eggs prior to the increase. Both patterns resulted in a higher net number of surviving offspring for temperate populations. Here we again examine the clinal pattern in reproduction using outdoor cages, this time held under tropical winter conditions. In this environment, surprisingly, egg production was higher and on average earlier in populations originating from temperate areas. However, mortality rates also increased with latitude of origin, and the relationship of lifetime egg production to latitude should therefore be measured. To test the role of altered pattern of egg production per se in the reproductive advantage of temperate populations in the temperate winter, we tested the performance of laboratory lines selected for altered reproductive patterns, under temperate winter conditions. Lines selected for high early fecundity exhibited this characteristic in the field cages and lines selected for late reproduction exhibited a relatively high fecundity in spring. The timing of the abrupt increase in egg production was identical in these sets of lines and occurred at the same time in recently collected populations, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the switch. These findings suggest that changes in early and late reproduction per se determine adaptation to temperate winter conditions, and illustrate how laboratory selection lines can be used to understand traits underlying adaptive shifts in field performance.},

abstract = {Evolution has, for a long time, inspired computer scientists to produce computer models mimicking its behavior. Evolutionary algorithm (EA) is one of the areas where this approach has flourished. EAs have been used to model and study evolution, but they have been especially developed for their aptitude as optimization tools for engineering. Developed models are quite simple in comparison with their natural sources of inspiration. However, since EAs run on computers, we have the freedom, especially in optimization models, to test approaches both realistic and outright speculative, from the biological point of view. In this article, we discuss different common evolutionary algorithm models, and then present some alternatives of interest. These include biologically inspired models, such as co-evolution and, in particular, symbiogenetics and outright artificial operators and representations. In each case, the advantages of the modifications to the standard model are identified. The other area of computational evolution, which has allowed us to study basic principles of evolution and ecology dynamics, is the development of artificial life platforms for open-ended evolution of artificial organisms. With these platforms, biologists can test theories by directly manipulating individuals and operators, observing the resulting effects in a realistic way. An overview of the most prominent of such environments is also presented. If instead of artificial platforms we use the real world for evolving artificial life, then we are dealing with evolutionary robotics (ERs). A brief description of this area is presented, analyzing its relations to biology. Finally, we present the conclusions and identify future research avenues in the frontier of computation and biology. Hopefully, this will help to draw the attention of more biologists and computer scientists to the benefits of such interdisciplinary research.},

Genetic differentiation is well known to affect thermal performance, but the effects of sex and developmental phenotypic plasticity often go uncharacterized. We used common garden experiments to test for effects of local adaptation, developmental phenotypic plasticity and individual sex on thermal performance of the ubiquitous copepod, Acartia tonsa (Calanoida, Crustacea) from two populations strongly differing in thermal regimes (Florida and Connecticut, USA). Females had higher thermal tolerance than males in both populations, while the Florida population had higher thermal tolerance compared with the Connecticut population. An effect of developmental phenotypic plasticity on thermal tolerance was observed only in the Connecticut population. Our results show clearly that thermal performance is affected by complex interactions of the three tested variables. Ignoring sex-specific differences in thermal performance may result in a severe underestimation of population-level impacts of warming because of population decline due to sperm limitation. Furthermore, despite having a higher thermal tolerance, low-latitude populations may be more vulnerable to warming as they lack the ability to respond to increases in temperature through phenotypic plasticity.},

Consistent with phenotypic studies, we find less clinal variation in D. simulans than D. melanogaster, particularly for the autosomes. Moreover, we find that clinally varying loci in D. simulans are less stable over multiple years than comparable clines in D. melanogaster. D. simulans shows a significantly weaker pattern of isolation by distance than D. melanogaster and we find evidence for a stronger contribution of migration to D. simulans population genetic structure. While population bottlenecks and migration can plausibly explain the differences in stability of clinal variation between the two species, we also observe a significant enrichment of shared clinal genes, suggesting that the selective forces associated with climate are acting on the same genes and phenotypes in D. simulans and D. melanogaster.},

abstract = {The adaptive significance of enzyme variation has been of central interest in population genetics. Yet, how natural selection operates on enzymes in the larger context of biochemical pathways has not been broadly explored. A basic expectation is that natural selection on metabolic phenotypes will target enzymes that control metabolic flux, but how adaptive variation is distributed among enzymes in metabolic networks is poorly understood. Here, we use population genetic methods to identify enzymes responding to adaptive selection in the pathways of central metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. We report polymorphism and divergence data for 17 genes that encode enzymes of 5 metabolic pathways that converge at glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Deviations from neutral expectations were observed at five loci. Of the 10 genes that encode the enzymes of glycolysis, only aldolase (Ald) deviated from neutrality. The other 4 genes that were inconsistent with neutral evolution (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6pd]), phosphoglucomutase [Pgm], trehalose-6-phosphate synthetase [Tps1], and glucose-6phosphatase [G6pase] encode G6P branch point enzymes that catalyze reactions at the entry point to the pentose-phosphate, glycogenic, trehalose synthesis, and gluconeogenic pathways. We reconcile these results with population genetics theory and existing arguments on metabolic regulation and propose that the incidence of adaptive selection in this system is related to the distribution of flux control. The data suggest that adaptive evolution of G6P branch point enzymes may have special significance in metabolic adaptation.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {To better characterize how variation in regulatory sequences drives divergence in gene expression, we undertook a systematic study of transcription factor binding and gene expression in blastoderm embryos of four species, which sample much of the diversity in the 40 million-year old genus Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. We compared gene expression, measured by mRNA-seq, to the genome-wide binding, measured by ChIP-seq, of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning. We found that mRNA levels are much better conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and that changes in a gene's expression were poorly explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites, sites in regions bound by multiple factors and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding, suggesting that a considerable amount of transcription factor binding is weakly or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Paris et al.},

Complex traits and their evolution have been studied for more than a century, but only in the last decade have genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in humans begun to reveal their genetic basis. Here, we bring these threads of research together to ask how findings from GWASs can further our understanding of the processes that give rise to heritable variation in complex traits and of the genetic basis of complex trait evolution in response to changing selection pressures (i.e., of polygenic adaptation). Conversely, we ask how evolutionary thinking helps us to interpret findings from GWASs and informs related efforts of practical importance.},

At least nine ideas exist regarding how plasticity may be costly or limited, but these have rarely been discussed together. The most commonly discussed cost is that of maintaining the sensory and regulatory machinery needed for plasticity, which may require energy and material expenses. A frequently considered limit to the benefit of plasticity is that the environmental cues guiding plastic development can be unreliable. Such costs and limits have recently been included in theoretical models and, perhaps more importantly, relevant empirical studies now have emerged. Despite the current interest in costs and limits of plasticity, several lines of reasoning suggest that they might be difficult to demonstrate.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms are a heuristic global optimisation technique mimicking the action of natural selection to solve hard optimisation problems, which has enjoyed growing usage in evolution and ecology. However, there is little standardisation in how genetic algorithms are implemented in these fields and even less practical advice for those hoping to implement genetic algorithms for their own models. This article aims to demystify genetic algorithms and provide assistance to researchers; basic programming knowledge is important for working with genetic algorithms, but none is required to read this article. I review the basics of genetic algorithm methodology and provide suggestions on problems that may or may not benefit from genetic algorithm methods. The genetic operators (selection, replacement, mutation, crossover) and their rate parameters (mutation rate, etc.) are a source of potential confusion and to ease their selection, I present recommendations informed by historical usage and best practices, concluding with potential pitfalls. Good reasons for employing genetic algorithms include: solving optimisation problems beyond the reach of analytical techniques, relaxing model assumptions, evolving behaviour in individual-based models, and simulating co-evolutionary processes. However, genetic algorithms are not always the correct technique to use. Simpler methods may sometimes outperform genetic algorithms, and certain problem features may cause trouble. Genetic algorithms strike a balance between exploration of the search space and exploitation of good solutions, driven by the choice of genetic operators and rate parameters. I outline a basic set of parameter values and operator choices for genetic algorithm models as a starting point and provide advice on how to modify them to explore the exploitation/exploration trade-off. Finally, I provide general advice on analysis and reporting of these models. There are a number of potential issues that can surprise unwary users, such as rate parameter values that lead to pathological outcomes; I suggest ways to detect and correct these problems. Also, contrary to popular usage, genetic algorithms can find solutions to game theory problems but cannot guarantee their stability. Finally, while genetic algorithms offer great power and flexibility by drawing inspiration from evolutionary processes, they are (usually) not a faithful model of genetics or evolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {The genetic architecture of adaptive traits is of key importance to predict evolutionary responses. Most adaptive traits are polygenic—i.e., result from selection on a large number of genetic loci—but most molecularly characterized traits have a simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs) across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent responses for several phenotypes—e.g., fitness, metabolic rate, and fat content—and a strong polygenic response (99 selected alleles; mean s = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving replicates. We discerned different evolutionary paradigms based on the heterogeneous genomic patterns among replicates. Redundancy and quantitative trait (QT) paradigms fitted the experimental data better than simulations assuming independent selective sweeps. Our results show that natural D. simulans populations harbor a vast reservoir of adaptive variation facilitating rapid evolutionary responses using multiple alternative genetic pathways converging at a new phenotypic optimum. This key property of beneficial alleles requires the modification of testing strategies in natural populations beyond the search for convergence on the molecular level.},

abstract = {A leading intellectual challenge in evolutionary genetics is to identify the specific phenotypes that drive adaptation. Enzymes offer a particularly promising opportunity to pursue this question, because many enzymes' contributions to organismal fitness depend on a comparatively small number of experimentally accessible properties. Moreover, on first principles the demands of enzyme thermostability stand in opposition to the demands of catalytic activity. This observation, coupled with the fact that enzymes are only marginally thermostable, motivates the widely held hypothesis that mutations conferring functional improvement require compensatory mutations to restore thermostability. Here, we explicitly test this hypothesis for the first time, using four missense mutations in TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase that jointly increase cefotaxime Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) ∼1500-fold. First, we report enzymatic efficiency (kcat/KM) and thermostability (Tm, and thence $\Delta$G of folding) for all combinations of these mutations. Next, we fit a quantitative model that predicts MIC as a function of kcat/KM and $\Delta$G. While kcat/KM explains ∼54{\%} of the variance in cefotaxime MIC (∼92{\%} after log transformation), $\Delta$G does not improve explanatory power of the model. We also find that cefotaxime MIC rises more slowly in kcat/KM than predicted. Several explanations for these discrepancies are suggested. Finally, we demonstrate substantial sign epistasis in MIC and kcat/KM, and antagonistic pleiotropy between phenotypes, in spite of near numerical additivity in the system. Thus constraints on selectively accessible trajectories, as well as limitations in our ability to explain such constraints in terms of underlying mechanisms are observed in a comparatively "well-behaved" system.},

abstract = {Genomic islands are clusters of loci with elevated divergence that are commonly found in population genomic studies of local adaptation and speciation. One explanation for their evolution is that linkage between selected alleles confers a benefit, which increases the establishment probability of new mutations that are linked to existing locally adapted polymorphisms. Previous theory suggested there is only limited potential for the evolution of islands via this mechanism, but involved some simplifying assumptions that may limit the accuracy of this inference. Here, we extend previous analytical approaches to study the effect of linkage on the establishment probability of new mutations and identify parameter regimes that are most likely to lead to evolution of islands via this mechanism. We show how the interplay between migration and selection affects the establishment probability of linked vs. unlinked alleles, the expected maximum size of genomic islands, and the expected time required for their evolution. Our results agree with previous studies, suggesting that this mechanism alone is unlikely to be a general explanation for the evolution of genomic islands. However, this mechanism could occur more readily if there were other pre-adaptations to reduce local rates of recombination or increase the local density of mutational targets within the region of the island. We also show that island formation via erosion following secondary contact is much more rapid than island formation from de novo mutations, suggesting that this mechanism may be more likely.},

abstract = {Comparative studies of orthologous proteins of species evolved at different temperatures have revealed consistent patterns of temperature-related variation in thermal stabilities of structure and function. However, the precise mechanisms by which interspecific variations in sequence foster these adaptive changes remain largely unknown. Here, we compare orthologs of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDH) from marine molluscs adapted to temperatures ranging from −1.9 °C (Antarctica) to ∼55 °C (South China coast) and show how amino acid usage in different regions of the enzyme (surface, intermediate depth, and protein core) varies with adaptation temperature. This eukaryotic enzyme follows some but not all of the rules established in comparisons of archaeal and bacterial proteins. To link the effects of specific amino acid substitutions with adaptive variations in enzyme thermal stability, we combined site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and in vitro protein experimentation with in silico mutagenesis using molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) techniques. SDM and MDS methods generally but not invariably yielded common effects on protein stability. MDS analysis is shown to provide insights into how specific amino acid substitutions affect the conformational flexibilities of mobile regions (MRs) of the enzyme that are essential for binding and catalysis. Whereas these substitutions invariably lie outside of the MRs, they effectively transmit their flexibility-modulating effects to the MRs through linked interactions among surface residues. This discovery illustrates that regions of the protein surface lying outside of the site of catalysis can help establish an enzyme's thermal responses and foster evolutionary adaptation of function.},

abstract = {The abundant existence of proteins and regions that possess specific functions without being uniquely folded into unique 3D structures has become accepted by a significant number of protein scientists. Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases. Gaining structural and functional information about these proteins is a challenge, since they do not typically "freeze" while their "pictures are taken." However, despite or perhaps because of the experimental challenges, these fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting targets for modern protein research. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent advances in this exciting field and considers some of the basic lessons learned from the analysis of physics, chemistry, and biology of IDPs.},

abstract = {Although sudden death during sport is a rare event, it always has a tragic impact because it occurs in apparently healthy individuals and assumes great visibility through the news media, due to the high public profile of competitive athletes [1-4]. For centuries it was a mystery why cardiac arrest should occur in vigorous athletes, who had previously achieved extraordinary exercise performance without any symptoms. The cause was generally ascribed to myocardial infarction, even though evidence of ischemic myocardial necrosis was rarely reported. It is now clear that the most common mechanism of sudden death during sports activity is an abrupt ventricular tachyarrhythmia as a consequence of a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, either acquired or congenital [2, 4, 5]. The culprit diseases are often clinically silent and unlikely to be suspected or diagnosed on the basis of spontaneous symptoms. Systematic cardiovascular screening (including 12-lead ECG) of all subjects embarking in sports activity has the potential to identify those athletes at risk and to reduce mortality [6]. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag Italia.},

abstract = {Background: The details of a precise, accurate, and sensitive spectrophotometric method for measuring catalase activity are presented here. The assay was established for biological samples and depends on the rapid formation of a stable and colored carbonato-cobaltate (III) complex. Samples exhibiting catalase activity are incubated with hydrogen peroxide solution for 2 min prior to rapid mixing of the incubation enzymatic reaction mixture with cobalt-bicarbonate reagent, which assesses non-reacting hydrogen peroxide. Catalase activity is always directly proportional to the rate of dissociation of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide acts to oxidize cobalt (II) to cobalt (III) in the presence of bicarbonate ions; this process ends with the production of a carbonato-cobaltate (III) complex ([Co (CO3)3]Co). The formed end product has two maximum absorbance peaks: 440 nm and 640 nm. The 440-nm peak has been utilized for assessing catalase activity. Results: The catalase activity results of the current method for erythrocyte lysate homogenates were computationally identical to those of the dichromate method (r = 0.9950). The coefficient of variation was calculated to determine the imprecision of the current assay. The within-run and between-run results were 2.96 and 3.83{\%}, respectively. Conclusion: This method is appropriate for analyzing bacteria, red blood cells and liver and kidney tissue homogenates.},

The method is validated on majority-on and multiplexer benchmark problems exhibiting various combinations of heterogeneity, epistasis, overlap, noise in class associations, missing data, extraneous features, and imbalanced classes. We also validate on a more realistic synthetic genome dataset with heterogeneity, epistasis, extraneous features, and noise. In all synthetic epistatic benchmarks, we consistently recover the true causal rule sets used to generate the data. Finally, we discuss an application to a complex real-world survey dataset designed to inform possible ecohealth interventions for Chagas disease.},

abstract = {Psychrophilic microorganisms thrive in permanently cold environments, even at subzero temperatures. To maintain metabolic rates compatible with sustained life, they have improved the dynamics of their protein structures, thereby enabling appropriate molecular motions required for biological activity at low temperatures. As a consequence of this structural flexibility, psychrophilic proteins are unstable and heat-labile. In the upper range of biological temperatures, thermophiles and hyperthermophiles grow at temperatures {\textgreater} 100 °C and synthesize ultra-stable proteins. However, thermophilic enzymes are nearly inactive at room temperature as a result of their compactness and rigidity. At the molecular level, both types of extremophilic proteins have adapted the same structural factors, but in opposite directions, to address either activity at low temperatures or stability in hot environments. A model based on folding funnels is proposed accounting for the stability-activity relationships in extremophilic proteins. {\textcopyright} 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The majority of Drosophila genes are expressed in a temperature-dependent manner, but the way in which small RNAs may contribute to this effect is completely unknown as we currently lack an idea of how small RNA transcriptomes change as a function of temperature. Applying high-throughput sequencing techniques complemented by quantitative real-time PCR experiments, we demonstrate that altered ambient temperature induces drastic but reversible changes in sequence composition and total abundance of both miRNA and piRNA populations. Further, mRNA sequencing reveals that the expression of miRNAs and their predicted target transcripts correlates inversely, suggesting that temperature-responsive miRNAs drive adaptation to different ambient temperatures on the transcriptome level. Finally, we demonstrate that shifts in temperature affect both primary and secondary piRNA pools, and the observed aberrations are consistent with altered expression levels of the involved Piwi-pathway factors. We further reason that enhanced ping-pong processing at 29°C is driven by dissolved RNA secondary structures at higher temperatures, uncovering target sites that are not accessible at low temperatures. Together, our results show that small RNAs are an important part of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that ensure homeostasis and adaptation under fluctuating environmental conditions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused primarily by pathogenic variants in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. We report genetic testing results for HCM in 2,912 unrelated individuals with nonsyndromic presentations from a broad referral population over 10 years. METHODS: Genetic testing was performed by Sanger sequencing for 10 genes from 2004 to 2007, by HCM CardioChip for 11 genes from 2007 to 2011 and by next-generation sequencing for 18, 46, or 51 genes from 2011 onward. RESULTS: The detection rate is {\~{}}32{\%} among unselected probands, with inconclusive results in an additional 15{\%}. Detection rates were not significantly different between adult and pediatric probands but were higher in females compared with males. An expanded gene panel encompassing more than 50 genes identified only a very small number of additional pathogenic variants beyond those identifiable in our original panels, which examined 11 genes. Familial genetic testing in at-risk family members eliminated the need for longitudinal cardiac evaluations in 691 individuals. Based on the projected costs derived from Medicare fee schedules for the recommended clinical evaluations of HCM family members by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association, our data indicate that genetic testing resulted in a minimum cost savings of about {\$}0.7 million. CONCLUSION: Clinical HCM genetic testing provides a definitive molecular diagnosis for many patients and provides cost savings to families. Expanded gene panels have not substantively increased the clinical sensitivity of HCM testing, suggesting major additional causes of HCM still remain to be identified.Genet Med 17 11, 880-888.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain used in the live attenuated influenza vaccine was changed for the 2015–2016 influenza season because of its lack of effectiveness in young children in 2013–2014. The Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network evaluated the effect of this change as part of its estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in 2015–2016. METHODS: We enrolled patients 6 months of age or older who presented with acute respiratory illness at ambulatory care clinics in geographically diverse U.S. sites. Using a test-negative design, we estimated vaccine effectiveness as (1−OR)×100, in which OR is the odds ratio for testing positive for influenza virus among vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. Separate estimates were calculated for the inactivated vaccines and the live attenuated vaccine. RESULTS: Among 6879 eligible participants, 1309 (19{\%}) tested positive for influenza virus, predominantly for A(H1N1)pdm09 (11{\%}) and influenza B (7{\%}). The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against any influenza illness was 48{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 41 to 55; P{\textless}0.001). Among children 2 to 17 years of age, the inactivated influenza vaccine was 60{\%} effective (95{\%} CI, 47 to 70; P{\textless}0.001), and the live attenuated vaccine was not observed to be effective (vaccine effectiveness, 5{\%}; 95{\%} CI, −47 to 39; P=0.80). Vaccine effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 among children was 63{\%} (95{\%} CI, 45 to 75; P{\textless}0.001) for the inactivated vaccine, as compared with −19{\%} (95{\%} CI, −113 to 33; P=0.55) for the live attenuated vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccines reduced the risk of influenza illness in 2015–2016. However, the live attenuated vaccine was found to be ineffective among children in a year with substantial inactivated vaccine effectiveness. Because the 2016–2017 A(H1N1)pdm09 strain used in the live attenuated vaccine was unchanged from 2015–2016, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made an interim recommendation not to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine for the 2016–2017 influenza season.},

abstract = {Invasive species are increasingly prevalent in marine ecosystems worldwide. Although many studies have examined the ecological effects of invasives, little is known about the physiological mechanisms that might contribute to invasive success. The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, a native of the Mediterranean Sea, is a successful invader on the central and southern coasts of California, where it has largely displaced the native congener, Mytilus trossulus. It has been previously shown that thermal responses of several physiological traits may underlie the capacity of M. galloprovincialis to out-compete M. trossulus in warm habitats. To elucidate possible differences in stress-induced gene expression between these congeners, we developed an oligonucleotide microarray with 8874 probes representing 4488 different genes that recognized mRNAs of both species. In acute heat-stress experiments, 1531 of these genes showed temperature-dependent changes in expression that were highly similar in the two congeners. By contrast, 96 genes showed species-specific responses to heat stress, functionally characterized by their involvement in oxidative stress, proteolysis, energy metabolism, ion transport, cell signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization. The gene that showed the biggest difference between the species was the gene for the molecular chaperone small heat shock protein 24, which was highly induced in M. galloprovincialis and showed only a small change in M. trossulus. These different responses to acute heat stress may help to explain - and predict - the invasive success of M. galloprovincialis in a warming world.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology. Journal of Evolutionary Biology {\textcopyright} 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology Temperature variation is one of the primary challenges facing ectotherms, and the ability to tolerate a range of thermal environments is critical for setting current and future species distributions. Low temperature is particularly challenging for ectotherms because winter conditions have strong latitudinal and temporal variation. Lower lethal temperature (LLT) is a common metric of cold tolerance used in studies of local adaptation and plasticity. Comparisons of LLT across groups typically assume parallel S-shaped survival curves, but genetic variation in the shape of survival vs. temperature curves has not been assessed. Here, we measured the ability of 36 lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to survive a 1-h cold shock at seven ecologically relevant low temperatures (−1 to −7 °C) to create a high-resolution response curve for each genotype. We observed surprising variation both in the magnitude of survival and in the shapes of the response curves, with the curves clustering into four distinct shapes. To encompass variation in the shapes of these survival curves, we developed a new cold tolerance metric, cumulative cold tolerance (CCT). By comparing our survival data with climatological data, we propose that variation in the shapes of cold-survival curves arose from weak selection pressure to survive intermediate subzero temperatures in this mid-latitude population of flies. Using publicly available genome sequence and transcript expression data for these lines, we identified several candidate genes associated with CCT, and using transgenic RNAi, we confirmed a functional role for many of these genes.},

Because large-effect loci are quickly fixed in natural populations, they should not contribute much to rapid adaptation. To investigate the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation — a highly complex trait — we performed experimental evolution on a natural Drosophila simulans population. Transcriptome and respiration measurements reveal extensive metabolic rewiring after only approximately 60 generations in a hot environment. Analysis of genome-wide polymorphisms identifies two interacting selection targets, Sestrin and SNF4A$\gamma$, pointing to AMPK, a central metabolic switch, as a key factor for thermal adaptation. Our results demonstrate that large-effect loci segregating at intermediate allele frequencies can allow natural populations to rapidly respond to selection. Because SNF4A$\gamma$ also exhibits clinal variation in various Drosophila species, we suggest that this large-effect polymorphism is maintained by temporal and spatial temperature variation in natural environments.},

abstract = {In all eukaryotic species examined, meiotic recombination, and crossovers in particular, occur non-randomly along chromosomes. The cause for this non-random distribution remains poorly understood but some specific DNA sequence motifs have been shown to be enriched near crossover hotspots in a number of species. We present analyses using machine learning algorithms to investigate whether DNA motif distribution across the genome can be used to predict crossover variation in Drosophila melanogaster, a species without hotspots. Our study exposes a combinatorial non-linear influence of motif presence able to account for a significant fraction of the genome-wide variation in crossover rates at all genomic scales investigated, from 20{\%} at 5-kb to almost 70{\%} at 2,500-kb scale. The models are particularly predictive for regions with the highest and lowest crossover rates and remain highly informative after removing sub-telomeric and -centromeric regions known to have strongly reduced crossover rates. Transcriptional activity during early meiosis and differences in motif use between autosomes and the X chromosome add to the predictive power of the models. Moreover, we show that population-specific differences in crossover rates can be partly explained by differences in motif presence. Our results suggest that crossover distribution in Drosophila is influenced by both meiosis-specific chromatin dynamics and very local constitutive open chromatin associated with DNA motifs that prevent nucleosome stabilization. These findings provide new information on the genetic factors influencing variation in recombination rates and a baseline to study epigenetic mechanisms responsible for plastic recombination as response to different biotic and abiotic conditions and stresses.},

abstract = {Many terrestrial ectothermic species exhibit limited variation in upper thermal tolerance across latitude. However, these trends may not signify limited adaptive capacity to increase thermal tolerance in the face of climate change. Instead, thermal tolerance may be similar among populations because behavioral thermoregulation by mobile organisms or life stages may buffer natural selection for thermal tolerance. We compared thermal tolerance of adults and embryos among natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from a broad range of thermal habitats around the globe to assess natural variation of thermal tolerance in mobile vs. immobile life stages. We found no variation among populations in adult thermal tolerance, but embryonic thermal tolerance was higher in tropical than in temperate regions. Average maximum temperature of the warmest month of the year predicted embryonic thermal tolerance in tropical but not temperate sites. We further report that embryos live closer to their upper thermal limits than adults; i.e., thermal safety margins are smaller for embryos than adults. F1 hybrid embryos from crosses between temperate and tropical populations had thermal tolerance that matched that of tropical embryos, suggesting phenotypic dominance of heat-tolerant alleles. Together our findings demonstrate that embryonic thermal tolerance readily evolves and suggest that selection for thermal tolerance may be limited in adults. Further, our results suggest that thermal traits should be measured across life stages in order to better predict adaptive limits.},

The mechanisms underlying chilling injuries and the subsequent recovery phase are only beginning to be understood in insects. Hsp22 and Hsp23 are both upregulated during the recovery from prolonged chill coma in Drosophila melanogaster. This prompted us to investigate the functional significance of these modulations by testing whether expression of these two small Hsps is necessary for recovery after cold stress. We used the GAL4/UAS system to separately knock down expression of Hsp22 and Hsp23, and assayed three aspects of recovery performance in transgenic adults that had undergone 12 h of chill coma at 0°C. The time to recover (short-term recovery) and mobility parameters (mediumterm recovery) were significantly impaired in the transgenic flies in which Hsp22 or Hsp23 was suppressed. Our findings show that both Hsp22 and Hsp23 play important roles in the recovery from chill coma in adult males, and suggest that these contribute to adaptive responses to fluctuating thermal conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {A significant problem for evolving artificial neural networks is that the physical arrangement of sensors and effectors is invisible to the evolutionary algorithm. For example, in this paper, directional sensors and effectors are placed around the circumference of a robot in analogous arrangements. This configuration ensures that there is a useful geometric correspondence between sensors and effectors. However, if sensors are mapped to a single input layer and the effectors to a single output layer (as is typical), evolution has no means to exploit this fortuitous arrangement. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel generative encoding called connective Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (connective CPPNs) that can effectively detect and capitalize on geometric relationships among sensors and effectors. The key insight is that sensors and effectors with consistent geometric relationships can be exploited by a repeating motif in the neural architecture. Thus, by employing an encoding that can discover such motifs as a function of network geometry, it becomes possible to exploit it. In this paper, a method for evolving connective CPPNs called Hypercube-based Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) discovers sensible repeating motifs that take advantage of two different placement schemes, demonstrating the utility of such an approach.

abstract = {Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and {\textgreater} 16,000 nonexperimental, local- scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5- 261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

abstract = {In the event of pandemic influenza, only limited supplies of vaccine may be available. We use stochastic epidemic simulations, genetic algorithms (GA), and random mutation hill climbing (RMHC) to find optimal vaccine distributions to minimize the number of illnesses or deaths in the population, given limited quantities of vaccine. Due to the non-linearity, complexity and stochasticity of the epidemic process, it is not possible to solve for optimal vaccine distributions mathematically. However, we use GA and RMHC to find near optimal vaccine distributions. We model an influenza pandemic that has age-specific illness attack rates similar to the Asian pandemic in 1957-1958 caused by influenza A(H2N2), as well as a distribution similar to the Hong Kong pandemic in 1968-1969 caused by influenza A(H3N2). We find the optimal vaccine distributions given that the number of doses is limited over the range of 10-90{\%} of the population. While GA and RMHC work well in finding optimal vaccine distributions, GA is significantly more efficient than RMHC. We show that the optimal vaccine distribution found by GA and RMHC is up to 84{\%} more effective than random mass vaccination in the mid range of vaccine availability. GA is generalizable to the optimization of stochastic model parameters for other infectious diseases and population structures. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Vision is the dominant sensory modality in many organisms for foraging, predator avoidance, and social behaviors including mate selection. Vertebrate visual perception is initiated when light strikes rod and cone photoreceptors within the neural retina of the eye. Sensitivity to individual colors, i.e., peak spectral sensitivities ($\lambda$max) of visual pigments, are a function of the type of chromophore and the amino acid sequence of the associated opsin protein in the photoreceptors. Large differences in peak spectral sensitivities can result from minor differences in amino acid sequence of cone opsins. To determine how minor sequence differences could result in large spectral shifts we selected a spectrally-diverse group of 14 teleost Rh2 cone opsins for which sequences and $\lambda$max are experimentally known. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out after embedding chromophore-associated homology structures within explicit bilayers and water. These simulations revealed structural features of visual pigments, particularly within the chromophore, that contributed to diverged spectral sensitivities. Statistical tests performed on all the observed structural parameters associated with the chromophore revealed that a two-term, first-order regression model was sufficient to accurately predict $\lambda$max over a range of 452–528 nm. The approach was accurate, efficient and simple in that site-by-site molecular modifications or complex quantum mechanics models were not required to predict $\lambda$max. These studies identify structural features associated with the chromophore that may explain diverged spectral sensitivities, and provide a platform for future, functionally predictive opsin modeling.},

Phenotypic plasticity is the change in the expressed phenotype of a genotype as a function of the environment. Various measures of plasticity exist, many of which can be united within the framework of a polynomial function. This function is the norm of reaction. For the special case of a linear reaction norm, genetic variation can be partitioned into portions that are independent and dependent on the environment. From this partition two heritability measures are derived which can be used, alternatively, to compare populations or make predictions about the response to selection. Genetically, plasticity is likely due both to differences in allelic expression across environments and to changes in interactions among loci; plasticity is not a function of heterozygosity. Plasticity responds to both artificial and natural selection. The evolution of plasticity is modeled in three ways: optimality models, quantitative genetic models, and gametic models. All models make similar predictions about the conditions that will favor plasticity. In need of further development are the extension of quantitative genetic models, and structured population models; also needed are data on the true shapes of reaction norms and genetic variation and covariation for nonlinear reaction norm parameters and multiple environments.To achieve a coherent evolutionary theory, it is necessary to account for the effects of the environment on the process of development.

Although SCD risk with recreational exercise is less well defined, published guidelines for participation in recreational sports, based on a consensus of expert opinion, offer a valuable framework for counseling patients. Exercise stress testing is an important diagnostic and prognostic tool in the evaluation of HCM patients, providing an objective measure of functional capacity, physiologic hemodynamic responses to stress, presence of ischemia, and provocable left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The value of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in HCM is less well studied than in the heart failure population, but can be used to set a safe target for exercise intensity as part of an individualized exercise prescription. The long-term effects of exercise on HCM pathophysiology are largely theoretical at this stage. Potential harmful effects of fatiguing exercise include prolonged contractile dysfunction resulting from microvascular ischemia and energetic compromise. Conversely, several animal studies have shown that voluntary exercise prevents or reverses many pathologic features of HCM, including those related to apoptosis and energetics. Substantial evidence for health-promoting benefits of exercise in the general population, in addition to promising safety and efficacy data in patients with chronic heart failure, emphasizes the need to attain a reasonable balance between potential risks and benefits of aerobic fitness in individuals with HCM.},

abstract = {The biotechnological applications of enzymes are limited due to the activity-stability trade-off, which implies that an increase in activity is accompanied by a concomitant decrease in protein stability. This premise is based on thermally adapted homologous enzymes where cold-adapted enzymes show high intrinsic activity linked to enhanced thermolability. In contrast, thermophilic enzymes show low activity around ambient temperatures. Nevertheless, genetically and chemically modified enzymes are beginning to show that the activity-stability trade-off can be overcome. In this review, the origin of the activity-stability trade-off, the thermodynamic basis for enhanced activity and stability, and various approaches for escaping the activity-stability trade-off are discussed. The role of entropy in enhancing both the activity and the stability of enzymes is highlighted with a special emphasis placed on the involvement of solvent water molecules. This review is concluded with suggestions for further research, which underscores the implications of these findings in the context of productivity curves, the Daniel-Danson equilibrium model, catalytic antibodies, and life on cold planets.},

Here we have identified new genes, transcripts and proteins using poly(A)(+) RNA sequencing from Drosophila melanogaster in cultured cell lines, dissected organ systems and under environmental perturbations. We found that a small set of mostly neural-specific genes has the potential to encode thousands of transcripts each through extensive alternative promoter usage and RNA splicing. The magnitudes of splicing changes are larger between tissues than between developmental stages, and most sex-specific splicing is gonad-specific. Gonads express hundreds of previously unknown coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which are antisense to protein-coding genes and produce short regulatory RNAs. Furthermore, previously identified pervasive intergenic transcription occurs primarily within newly identified introns. The fly transcriptome is substantially more complex than previously recognized, with this complexity arising from combinatorial usage of promoters, splice sites and polyadenylation sites.},

abstract = {Pandemic influenza has posed an increasing threat to public health worldwide in the last decade. In the 20th century, three human pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968, causing significant mortality. A number of hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence and development of pandemic viruses, including direct introduction into humans from an avian origin and reassortment between avian and previously circulating human viruses, either directly in humans or via an intermediate mammalian host. However, the evolutionary history of the pandemic viruses has been controversial, largely due to the lack of background genetic information and rigorous phylogenetic analyses. The pandemic that emerged in early April 2009 in North America provides a unique opportunity to investigate its emergence and development both in human and animal aspects. Recent genetic analyses of data accumulated through long-term influenza surveillance provided insights into the emergence of this novel pandemic virus. In this review, we summarise the recent literature that describes the evolutionary pathway of the pandemic viruses. We also discuss the implications of these findings on the early detection and control of future pandemics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We generated whole-genome estimates of allele frequencies from flies sampled during the spring and fall from 15 localities. We show that seasonal adaptation is a general feature fly populations and that the direction of seasonal adaptation can be predicted by weather conditions in the weeks prior to sampling. We find that seasonal changes in allele frequency are mirrored by spatial variation in allele frequency and that seasonal adaptation affects allele frequencies at {\~{}}1.0-2.5{\%} of polymorphisms genome-wide.

abstract = {Human skin pigmentation is the product of two clines produced by natural selection to adjust levels of constitutive pigmentation to levels of UV radiation (UVR). One cline was generated by high UVR near the equator and led to the evolution of dark, photoprotective, eumelanin-rich pigmentation. The other was produced by the requirement for UVB photons to sustain cutaneous photosynthesis of vitamin D(3) in low-UVB environments, and resulted in the evolution of depigmented skin. As hominins dispersed outside of the tropics, they experienced different intensities and seasonal mixtures of UVA and UVB. Extreme UVA throughout the year and two equinoctial peaks of UVB prevail within the tropics. Under these conditions, the primary selective pressure was to protect folate by maintaining dark pigmentation. Photolysis of folate and its main serum form of 5-methylhydrofolate is caused by UVR and by reactive oxygen species generated by UVA. Competition for folate between the needs for cell division, DNA repair, and melanogenesis is severe under stressful, high-UVR conditions and is exacerbated by dietary insufficiency. Outside of tropical latitudes, UVB levels are generally low and peak only once during the year. The populations exhibiting maximally depigmented skin are those inhabiting environments with the lowest annual and summer peak levels of UVB. Development of facultative pigmentation (tanning) was important to populations settling between roughly 23 degrees and 46 degrees , where levels of UVB varied strongly according to season. Depigmented and tannable skin evolved numerous times in hominin evolution via independent genetic pathways under positive selection.},

Flies from Europe colonized the east coast United States while flies from Africa inhabited the Caribbean, which if true, make the south-east US and Caribbean Islands a secondary contact zone for African and European D. melanogaster. This scenario has been proposed based on phenotypes and limited genetic data. In our study, we have sequenced individual whole genomes of flies from populations in the south-east US and Caribbean Islands and examined these populations in conjunction with population sequences from the west coast US, Africa, and Europe. We find that west coast US populations are closely related to the European population, likely reflecting a rapid westward expansion upon first settlements into North America. We also find genomic evidence of African and European admixture in south-east US and Caribbean populations, with a clinal pattern of decreasing proportions of African ancestry with higher latitude. Our genomic analysis of D. melanogaster populations from the south-east US and Caribbean Islands provides more evidence for the Caribbean Islands as the source of previously reported novel African alleles found in other east coast US populations. We also find the border between the south-east US and the Caribbean island to be the admixture hot zone where distinctly African-like Caribbean flies become genomically more similar to European-like south-east US flies. Our findings have important implications for previous studies examining the generation of east coast US clines via selection.},

Integrating data for the genetic architecture of traits from genome-wide association mapping studies (GWAS) along with the development of new population genetic methods for identifying selection in sequence data may allow us to evaluate the roles of mutation–selection balance and balancing selection in shaping genetic variation at various scales. Here, we review the theoretical predictions for genetic architecture and additional signals of selection on genomic sequence for the loci that affect traits. Next, we review how plant GWAS have tested for the signatures of various selective scenarios. Limited evidence to date suggests that within-population variation is maintained primarily by mutation–selection balance while variation across the landscape is the result of local adaptation. However, there are a number of inherent biases in these interpretations. We highlight these challenges and suggest ways forward to further understanding of the maintenance of variation.},

Logistical difficulties and the spatiotemporal variability of populations make estimation of population declines difficult. For statistical reasons, estimates of population decline may be biased when study sites are chosen based on abundance of the focal species. In this situation, apparent population declines are likely to be detected even if there is no decline. This site-selection bias is mentioned in the literature but is not well known. We used simulations and real population data to examine the effects of site-selection biases on inferences about population trends. We used a left-censoring method to detect population-size patterns consistent with site-selection bias. The site-selection bias is an important consideration for conservation biologists, and we offer suggestions for minimizing or mitigating it in study design and analysis.

This approach considers biological group selection theory to encourage cooperation, and a new cooperation operator to build solutions hierarchically. It extends evolution from individuals to multiple group levels, leading to good performance on both individuals and groups. The applicability of this approach is evaluated on 7 multi-class classification problems with different features, such as non-linearity, skewed data distribution and large feature space. The results, when compared to other cooperative evolutionary algorithms in the literature, demonstrate that this approach improves solution accuracy and consistency, and simplifies solution complexity. In addition, the problem is decomposed as a result of evolution without human interference. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Population genetic models predict that alleles with small selection coefficients may be swamped by migration and will not contribute to local adaptation. But if most alleles contributing to standing variation are of small effect, how does local adaptation proceed? Here I review predictions of population and quantitative genetic models and use individual-based simulations to illustrate how the architecture of local adaptation depends on the genetic redundancy of the trait, the maintenance of standing genetic variation (VG), and the susceptibility of alleles to swamping. Even when population genetic models predict swamping for individual alleles, considerable local adaptation can evolve at the phenotypic level if there is sufficient VG. However, in such cases the underlying architecture of divergence is transient: FST is low across all loci, and no locus makes an important contribution for very long. Because this kind of local adaptation is mainly due to transient frequency changes and allelic covariances, these architectures will be difficult-if not impossible-to detect using current approaches to studying the genomic basis of adaptation. Even when alleles are large and resistant to swamping, architectures can be highly transient if genetic redundancy and mutation rates are high. These results suggest that drift can play a critical role in shaping the architecture of local adaptation, both through eroding VG and affecting the rate of turnover of polymorphisms with redundant phenotypic effects.},

Here we take the unique opportunity to compare a set of data for SNPs in 15 metabolic genes from eastern US collections of Drosophila melanogaster that span a large latitudinal range and represent two collections separated by 12 to 13 years. We also expand this to a 22-year interval for the Adh gene and approximately 30 years for the G6pd and Pgd genes. During these intervals, five genes showed a statistically significant change in average SNP allele frequency corrected for latitude. While much remains unchanged, we see five genes where latitudinal clines have been lost or gained and two where the slope significantly changes. The long-term frequency shift towards a southern favored Adh S allele reported in Australia populations is not observed in the eastern US over a period of 21 years. There is no general pattern of southern-favored or northern-favored alleles increasing in frequency across the genes. This observation points to the fluid nature of some allelic variation over this time period and the action of selective responses or migration that may be more regional than uniformly imposed across the cline.},

We exposed hives to a trace amount of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and to the acaricide thymol, and measured capped brood, bee and honey production, as well as the temperature and foraging force of the colonies. The effect of imidacloprid on colony dynamics differed between the two environments. In Tucson we recorded a positive effect of imidacloprid treatment on bee and brood numbers. Thymol was associated with short-term negative effects on bee numbers at both locations, and may have affected colony survival at one location. The overall benefits of thymol for the colonies were unclear. We conclude that long-term and colony-level measures of the effects of agrochemicals are needed to properly understand risks to bees.},

abstract = {During each heartbeat, cardiac contractility results from calciumactivated sliding of actin thin filaments toward the centers of myosin thick filaments to shorten cellular length. Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is a component of the thick filament that appears to tune these mechanochemical interactions by its N-terminal domains transiently interacting with actin and/or the myosin S2 domain, sensitizing thin filaments to calcium and governing maximal sliding velocity. Both functional mechanisms are potentially further tunable by phosphorylation of an intrinsically disordered, extensible region of cMyBP-C's N terminus, the M-domain. Using atomic force spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and mutant protein expression, we demonstrate that phosphorylation reduced the M-domain's extensibility and shifted the conformation of the N-terminal domain from an extended structure to a compact configuration. In combination with motility assay data, these structural effects of M-domain phosphorylation suggest a mechanism for diminishing the functional potency of individual cMyBP-C molecules. Interestingly, we found that calcium levels necessary to maximally activate the thin filament mitigated the structural effects of phosphorylation by increasing M-domain extensibility and shifting the phosphorylated N-terminal fragments back to the extended state, as if unphosphorylated. Functionally, the addition of calcium to the motility assays ablated the impact of phosphorylation on maximal sliding velocities, fully restoring cMyBP-C's inhibitory capacity. We conclude that M-domain phosphorylation may have its greatest effect on tuning cMyBP-C's calcium-sensitization of thin filaments at the low calcium levels between contractions. Importantly, calcium levels at the peak of contraction would allow cMyBP-C to remain a potent contractile modulator, regardless of cMyBP-C's phosphorylation state.},

abstract = {The range of thermal tolerance is one of the main factors influencing the geographic distribution of species. Climate change projections predict increases in average and extreme temperatures over the coming decades; hence, the ability of living beings to resist these changes will depend on physiological and adaptive responses. On an evolutionary scale, changes will occur as the result of selective pressures on individual heritable differences. In this work, we studied the genetic basis of tolerance to high temperatures in the fly Drosophila melanogaster and whether this species presents sufficient genetic variability to allow expansion of its upper thermo-tolerance limit. To do so, we used adult flies derived from a natural population belonging to the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, for which genomic sequencing data are available. We characterized the phenotypic variation of the upper thermal limit in 34 lines by measuring knockdown temperature (i.e., critical thermal maximum [CTmax]) by exposing flies to a ramp of increasing temperature (0.25°C/min). Fourteen percent of the variation in CTmax is explained by the genetic variation across lines, without a significant sexual dimorphism. Through a genomewide association study, 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the CTmax were identified. In most of these SNPs, the less frequent allele increased the upper thermal limit suggesting that this population harbors raw genetic variation capable of expanding its heat tolerance. This potential upper thermal tolerance increase has implications under the global warming scenario. Past climatic records show a very low incidence of days above CTmax (10 days over 25 years); however, future climate scenarios predict 243 days with extreme high temperature above CTmax from 2045 to 2070. Thus, in the context of the future climate warming, rising temperatures might drive the evolution of heat tolerance in this population by increasing the frequency of the alleles associated with higher CTmax.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations that increase gene expression are predicted to increase energy allocation to transcription, translation and protein function. Despite an appreciation that energetic tradeoffs may constrain adaptation, the energetic costs of increased gene expression are challenging to quantify and thus easily ignored when modeling the evolution of gene expression, particularly for multicellular organisms. Here we use the well-characterized, inducible heat-shock response to test whether expressing additional copies of the Hsp70 gene increases energetic demand in Drosophila melanogaster. RESULTS: We measured metabolic rates of larvae with different copy numbers of the Hsp70 gene to quantify energy expenditure before, during, and after exposure to 36 degrees C, a temperature known to induce robust expression of Hsp70. We observed a rise in metabolic rate within the first 30 minutes of 36 degrees C exposure above and beyond the increase in routine metabolic rate at 36 degrees C. The magnitude of this increase in metabolic rate was positively correlated with Hsp70 gene copy number and reflected an increase as great as 35{\%} of the 22 degrees C metabolic rate. Gene copy number also affected Hsp70 mRNA levels as early as 15 minutes after larvae were placed at 36 degrees C, demonstrating that gene copy number affects transcript abundance on the same timescale as the metabolic effects that we observed. Inducing Hsp70 also had lasting physiological costs, as larvae had significantly depressed metabolic rate when returned to 22 degrees C after induction. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate both immediate and persistent energetic consequences of gene copy number in a multicellular organism. We discuss these consequences in the context of existing literature on the pleiotropic effects of variation in Hsp70 copy number, and argue that the increased energetic demand of expressing extra copies of Hsp70 may contribute to known tradeoffs in physiological performance of extra-copy larvae. Physiological costs of mutations that greatly increase gene expression, such as these, may constrain their utility for adaptive evolution.},

Our results indicate that consideration of age-specific transmission dynamics is paramount to the optimal allocation of influenza vaccines.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Ogbunugafor et al. The adaptive landscape analogy has found practical use in recent years, as many have explored how their understanding can inform therapeutic strategies that subvert the evolution of drug resistance. A major barrier to applications of these concepts is a lack of detail concerning how the environment aff ects adaptive landscape topography, and consequently, the outcome of drug treatment. Here we combine empirical data, evolutionary theory, and computer simulations towards dissecting adaptive landscape by environment interactions for the evolution of drug resistance in two dimensions—drug concentration and drug type. We do so by studying the resistance mediated by Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to two related inhibitors—pyrimethamine and cycloguanil—across a breadth of drug concentrations. We first examine whether the adaptive landscapes for the two drugs are consistent with common definitions of cross-resistance. We then reconstruct all accessible pathways across the landscape, observing how their structure changes with drug environment. We offer a mechanism for non-linearity in the topography of accessible pathways by calculating of the interaction between mutation effects and drug environment, which reveals rampant patterns of epistasis. We then simulate evolution in several different drug environments to observe how these individual mutation effects (and patterns of epistasis) influence paths taken at evolutionary “forks in the road” that dictate adaptive dynamics in silico. In doing so, we reveal how classic metrics like the IC 50 and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) are dubious proxies for understanding how evolution will occur across drug environments. We also consider how the findings reveal ambiguities in the cross-resistance concept, as subtle differences in adaptive landscape topography between otherwise equivalent drugs can drive drastically different evolutionary outcomes. Summarizing, we discuss the results with regards to their basic contribution to the study of empirical adaptive landscapes, and in terms of how they inform new models for the evolution of drug resistance.},

abstract = {Many organisms modify their physiological functions by acclimating to changes in their environment. Recent studies of thermal physiology have been influenced by verbal models that fail to consider the selective advantage of acclimation and thus make no predictions about variation in acclimation capacity. We used a quantitative model of optimal plasticity to generate predictions about the capacity of Drosophila melanogaster to acclimate to developmental temperature. This model predicts that the ability to acclimate thermal sensitivity should evolve when temperature varies greatly among generations. Based on the model, we expected that flies from the highly seasonal environment of New Jersey would acclimate thermal sensitivity more than would flies from the less seasonal environment of Florida. When raised at constant and fluctuating temperatures, flies from these populations failed to adjust their thermal optima in the way predicted by the model, suggesting that current assumptions about functional and genetic constraints should be reconsidered. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Most natural populations are affected by seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall, or resource availability. Seasonally fluctuating selection could potentially make a large contribution to maintaining genetic polymorphism in populations. However, previous theory suggests that the conditions for multilocus polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more general class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped to fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across loci and accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous and homozygous loci—that is, dominance. The second step uses a nonlinear fitness function to account for the strength of selection and epistasis. Using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations, we show that stable polymorphism at many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are sufficiently dominant. This general mechanism, which we call “segregation lift,” requires seasonal changes in dominance, a phenomenon that may arise naturally in situations with antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal changes in the relative importance of traits for fitness. Segregation lift works best under diminishing-returns epistasis, is not affected by problems of genetic load, and is robust to differences in parameters across loci and seasons. Under segregation lift, loci can exhibit conspicuous seasonal allele-frequency fluctuations, but often fluctuations may be small and hard to detect. An important direction for future work is to formally test for segregation lift in empirical data and to quantify its contribution to maintaining genetic variation in natural populations.},

abstract = {The Mediterranean blue mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, is an invasive species that has displaced a congener, Mytilus trossulus, from its native range in central and southern California, USA. The dynamic relationship between interspecies competition and species-specific tolerances to abiotic factors, such as temperature and salinity, appears to have facilitated the success but has also imposed limits on the spread of this biological invasion. Here, we review the literature and present new data that document physiological differences between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. In all comparisons, M. galloprovincialis is more warm-adapted than M. trossulus. Higher activities of enzymes involved in ATP generation show that the native M. trossulus is better adapted to colder conditions than M. galloprovincialis. Higher metabolic capacity (temperature compensation) in the native species may, however, lead to higher metabolic costs at sites where the two species co-occur. In addition, M. trossulus has a lower thermal tolerance of cardiac function and substrate binding by enzymes than M. galloprovincialis. The higher thermal tolerance of the invasive species is likely due in part to its enhanced ability to induce changes in the expression of particular genes and proteins in response to acute heat stress. Taken together, these data predict that M. galloprovincialis will continue to be the dominant blue mussel species along the warmer range of the California Current. Because the northern biogeographic limit of M. galloprovincialis is not stable, but rather shifts to lower or higher latitudes in concert with oceanographic variability, it is important to further characterize the physiological constraints of M. galloprovincialis, related to its sensitivity to cold temperatures and low salinities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Heat shock (HS) initiates rapid, extensive, and evolutionarily conserved changes in transcription that are accompanied by chromatin decondensation and nucleosome loss at HS loci. Here we have employed in situ Hi-C to determine how heat stress affects long-range chromatin conformation in human and Drosophila cells. We found that compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) remain unchanged by an acute HS. Knockdown of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), the master transcriptional regulator of the HS response, identified HSF1-dependent genes and revealed that up-regulation is often mediated by distal HSF1 bound enhancers. HSF1-dependent genes were usually found in the same TAD as the nearest HSF1 binding site. Although most interactions between HSF1 binding sites and target promoters were established in the nonheat shock (NHS) condition, a subset increased contact frequency following HS. Integrating information about HSF1 binding strength, RNA polymerase abundance at the HSF1 bound sites (putative enhancers), and contact frequency with a target promoter accurately predicted which up-regulated genes were direct targets of HSF1 during HS. Our results suggest that the chromatin conformation necessary for a robust HS response is preestablished in NHS cells of diverse metazoan species.},

Case-control analyses were performed that used data from patients who were ill without influenza (hereafter, "test-negative control subjects") and data from asymptomatic control subjects from the population (hereafter, "traditional control subjects"). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as [100 x (1-adjusted odds ratio)]. Influenza isolates were antigenically characterized. RESULTS: Influenza was detected in 167 (20{\%}) of 818 patients in 2004-2005, in 51 (14{\%}) of 356 in 2005-2006, and in 102 (11{\%}) of 932 in 2006-2007. Analyses that used data from test-negative control subjects showed that VE was 10{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -36{\%} to 40{\%}) in 2004-2005, 21{\%} (95{\%} CI, -52{\%} to 59{\%}) in 2005-2006, and 52{\%} (95{\%} CI, 22{\%} to 70{\%}) in 2006-2007. Using data from traditional control subjects, VE for those seasons was estimated to be 5{\%} (95{\%} CI, -52{\%} to 40{\%}), 11{\%} (95{\%} CI, -96{\%} to 59{\%}), and 37{\%} (95{\%} CI, -10{\%} to 64{\%}), respectively; confidence intervals included 0. The percentage of viruses that were antigenically matched to vaccine strains was 5{\%} (3 of 62) in 2004-2005, 5{\%} (2 of 42) in 2005-2006, and 91{\%} (85 of 93) in 2006-2007. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza VE varied substantially across 3 seasons and was highest when antigenic match was optimal. VE estimates that used data from test-negative control subjects were consistently higher than those that used data from traditional control subjects.},

abstract = {Background The severity of the 2017-2018 influenza season in the U.S. was high with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. We report influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and estimate the number of vaccine prevented influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for the 2017-2018 influenza season. Methods We used national age-specific estimates of 2017-2018 influenza vaccine coverage and disease burden. We estimated VE, and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI), against medically-attended RT-PCR confirmed influenza virus infection, in the ambulatory setting, using a test-negative design. We estimated influenza type/subtype-specific burden using multipliers applied to population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations. We used a compartmental model to estimate numbers, with 95{\%} credible intervals (CrI), of influenza-associated outcomes prevented by vaccination. Results The VE against outpatient medically-attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza was 38{\%} (95{\%} CI: 31-43{\%}) including 22{\%} (95{\%} CI: 12-31{\%}) against influenza A(H3N2), 62{\%} (95{\%} CI: 50-71{\%}) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 50{\%} (95{\%} CI: 41-57{\%}) against influenza B. We estimated that influenza vaccination prevented 7.1 million (95{\%} CrI: 5.4 million-9.3 million) illnesses, 3.7 million (95{\%} CrI: 2.8 million-4.9 million) medical visits, 109,000 (95{\%} CrI: 39,000-231,000) hospitalizations, and 8,000 (95{\%} CrI: 1,100-21,000) deaths. Vaccination prevented 10{\%} of expected hospitalizations overall and 41{\%} among young children (6 months-4 years). Conclusions Despite 38{\%} VE, influenza vaccination reduced a substantial burden of influenza-associated illness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the U.S. during the 2017-2018 season. Our results demonstrate the benefit of current influenza vaccination and the need for improved vaccines.},

abstract = {There is growing concern over the effects of increased salinization on freshwater organisms, which are largely unknown for unionid mussels. Adult and larval Elliptio complanata were exposed to low-level salt concentrations to determine the effects on mussel survival, physiology, and reproduction. Adults were exposed to salt concentrations of 0 parts per thousand (ppt), 2 ppt, 4 ppt, and 6 ppt NaCl and monitored over 7 d for mortality. Treatment groups exposed to 6 ppt and 4 ppt experienced 50{\%} mortality at day 3 and day 4, respectively, with complete mortality by day 7. No mortality was observed in the other treatments. Adults were also exposed to sublethal salinity levels of 1 ppt and 2 ppt NaCl for 4 wk to determine physiological consequences of prolonged salinity exposure. Mussels exposed to 1 ppt and 2 ppt experienced reduced metabolic rates within the first 24h of exposure that recovered to control levels in the 1-ppt treatment within 7 d. Metabolic recovery did not occur in the 2-ppt treatment by the end of 28 d. Glochidia exposed to 3-ppt NaCl during attachment to their host fish suffered a reduction in attachment success and metamorphosis, resulting in a 10-fold reduction in the number of juveniles produced per host fish. The present study demonstrates that low levels of salt can have a dramatic effect on the reproduction, physiology, and survival of freshwater mussels. {\textcopyright} 2013 SETAC.},

abstract = {Mathematical models predict that species interactions such as competition and predation can generate chaos. However, experimental demonstrations of chaos in ecology are scarce, and have been limited to simple laboratory systems with a short duration and artificial species combinations. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a long-term experiment with a complex food web. Our food web was isolated from the Baltic Sea, and consisted of bacteria, several phytoplankton species, herbivorous and predatory zooplankton species, and detritivores. The food web was cultured in a laboratory mesocosm, and sampled twice a week for more than 2,300 days. Despite constant external conditions, the species abundances showed striking fluctuations over several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations displayed a variety of different periodicities, which could be attributed to different species interactions in the food web. The population dynamics were characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents of similar magnitude for each species. Predictability was limited to a time horizon of 15-30 days, only slightly longer than the local weather forecast. Hence, our results demonstrate that species interactions in food webs can generate chaos. This implies that stability is not required for the persistence of complex food webs, and that the long-term prediction of species abundances can be fundamentally impossible.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of virus mutation rates are important to understand the evolution of the viruses and to combat them. However, methods of estimation are varied and often complex. Here, we critically review over 40 original studies and establish criteria to facilitate comparative analyses. The mutation rates of 23 viruses are presented as substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection (s/n/c) and corrected for selection bias where necessary, using a new statistical method. The resulting rates range from 10(-8) to 10(-6) s/n/c for DNA viruses and from 10(-6) to 10(-4) s/n/c for RNA viruses. Similar to what has been shown previously for DNA viruses, there appears to be a negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size among RNA viruses, but this result requires further experimental testing. Contrary to some suggestions, the mutation rate of retroviruses is not lower than that of other RNA viruses. We also show that nucleotide substitutions are on average four times more common than insertions/deletions (indels). Finally, we provide estimates of the mutation rate per nucleotide per strand copying, which tends to be lower than that per cell infection because some viruses undergo several rounds of copying per cell, particularly double-stranded DNA viruses. A regularly updated virus mutation rate data set will be available at www.uv.es/rsanjuan/virmut.},

abstract = {A longstanding idea in evolutionary physiology is that an enzyme cannot jointly optimize performance at both high and low temperatures due to a trade-off between stability and activity. Although a stability-activity trade-off has been observed for well-characterized examples, such a trade-off is not imposed by any physical chemical constraint. To better understand the pervasiveness of this trade-off, I investigated the stability-activity relationship for comparative biochemical studies of purified orthologous enzymes identified by a literature search. The nature of this relationship varied greatly among studies. Notably, studies of enzymes with low mean synonymous nucleotide sequence divergence were less likely to exhibit the predicted negative correlation between stability and activity. Similarly, a survey of directed evolution investigations of the stability-activity relationship indicated that these traits are often uncoupled among nearly identical yet phenotypically divergent enzymes. This suggests that the presumptive trade-off often reported for investigations of enzymes with high mean sequence divergence may in some cases instead be a consequence of the degeneration over time of enzyme function in unselected environments, rather than a direct effect of thermal adaptation. The results caution against the general assertion of a stability-activity trade-off during enzyme adaptation.},

We then quantified the evolutionary differences between their evolutionary trajectories through the use of within- and between-scatter matrices computation to provide the statistical confidence to support the visualization results. We used the influenza surface Hemagglutinin (HA) gene for this study as the HA gene is the major target of the immune system. The visualization is achieved without using any clustering methods or prior information about the influenza sequences. Our results clearly showed that the evolutionary trajectories between vaccine-controlled and non-vaccine-controlled influenza viruses are different and vaccine as an evolution driving force cannot be completely eliminated.},

This is especially true for hybrid taxa, for which the degree of isolation in regard to their parental species is decisive in their capacity to rise as a new and stable entity. In this work, we explored the past and current patterns of hybridization and divergence within a complex of closely related butterflies in the genus Coenonympha in which two alpine species, C. darwiniana and C. macromma, have been shown to result from hybridization between the also alpine C. gardetta and the lowland C. arcania. By testing alternative scenarios of divergence among species, we show that gene flow has been uninterrupted throughout the speciation process, although leading to different degrees of current genetic isolation between species in contact zones depending on the pair considered. Nonetheless, at broader geographic scale, analyses reveal a clear genetic differentiation between hybrid lineages and their parental species, pointing out to an advanced stage of the hybrid speciation process. Finally, the positive correlation observed between ecological divergence and genetic isolation among these butterflies suggests a potential role for ecological drivers during their speciation processes.},

abstract = {Predicting whether and how populations will adapt to rapid climate change is a critical goal for evolutionary biology. To examine the genetic basis of fitness and predict adaptive evolution in novel climates with seasonal variation, we grew a diverse panel of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana (multiparent advanced generation intercross lines) in controlled conditions simulating four climates: a present-day reference climate, an increased-temperature climate, a winter-warming only climate, and a poleward-migration climate with increased photoperiod amplitude. In each climate, four successive seasonal cohorts experienced dynamic daily temperature and photoperiod variation over a year. We measured 12 traits and developed a genomic prediction model for fitness evolution in each seasonal environment. This model was used to simulate evolutionary trajectories of the base population over 50 y in each climate, as well as 100-y scenarios of gradual climate change following adaptation to a reference climate. Patterns of plastic and evolutionary fitness response varied across seasons and climates. The increased-temperature climate promoted genetic divergence of subpopulations across seasons, whereas in the winter-warming and poleward-migration climates, seasonal genetic differentiation was reduced. In silico “resurrection experiments” showed limited evolutionary rescue compared with the plastic response of fitness to seasonal climate change. The genetic basis of adaptation and, consequently, the dynamics of evolutionary change differed qualitatively among scenarios. Populations with fewer founding genotypes and populations with genetic diversity reduced by prior selection adapted less well to novel conditions, demonstrating that adaptation to rapid climate change requires the maintenance of sufficient standing variation.},

abstract = {Temperature is a strong selective force on the evolution of proteins due to its effects on higher orders of protein structure and, thereby, on critical protein functions like ligand binding and catalysis. Comparisons among orthologous proteins from differently thermally adapted species show consistent patterns of adaptive variation in function, but few studies have examined functional adaptation among multiple structural families of proteins. Thus, with our present state of knowledge, it is difficult to predict what fraction of the proteome will exhibit adaptive variation in the face of temperature increases of a few to several degrees Celsius, that is, temperature increases of the magnitude predicted by models of global warming. Here, we compared orthologous enzymes of the warm-adapted Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the cold-adapted Mytilus trossulus, a native of the North Pacific Ocean, species whose physiologies exhibit significantly different responses to temperature. We measured the effects of temperature on the kinetics (Michaelis-Menten constant-K(m)) of five enzymes that are important for ATP generation and that represent distinct protein structural families. Among phosphoglucomutase (PGM), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (IDH), only IDH orthologs showed significantly different thermal responses of K(m) between the two species. The K(m) of isocitrate of M. galloprovincialis-IDH was intrinsically lower and more thermally stable than that of M. trossulus-IDH and thus had higher substrate affinity at high temperatures. Two amino acid substitutions account for the functional differences between IDH orthologs, one of which allows for more hydrogen bonds to form near the mobile region of the active site in M. galloprovincialis-IDH. Taken together, our findings cast light on the targets of adaptive evolution in the context of climate change; only a minority of proteins might adapt to small changes in temperature, and these adaptations may involve only small changes in sequence.},

abstract = {Temperature has a profound effect on the structure and function of proteins. Studies on enzymes suggest that over evolutionary time, adaptation to temperature occurs through modification of the molecular flexibility of the protein, especially in hinge regions around which catalytically important mobile structures rotate or slide. Changes in flexibility can arise through substitutions that alter the numbers and types of weak interactions among amino acids. Cold adaptation usually involves a localized decrease in the strength of these interactions, leading to greater molecular flexibility. Increased stability, induced by greater numbers of weak interactions, characterizes warm adaptation. Because more flexibility leads to increased catalytic rate but decreased substrate affinity, it is difficult for an enzyme to function optimally across a broad range of temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Population limitation is a fundamental tenet of ecology, but the relative roles of exogenous and endogenous mechanisms remain unquantified for most species. Here we used multi-model inference (MMI), a form of model averaging, based on information theory (Akaike's Information Criterion) to evaluate the relative strength of evidence for density-dependent and density-independent population dynamical models in long-term abundance time series of 1198 species. We also compared the MMI results to more classic methods for detecting density dependence: Neyman-Pearson hypothesis-testing and best-model selection using the Bayesian Information Criterion or cross-validation. Using MMI on our large database, we show that density dependence is a pervasive feature of population dynamics (median MMI support for density dependence = 74.7-92.2{\%}), and that this holds across widely different taxa. The weight of evidence for density dependence varied among species but increased consistently, with the number of generations monitored. Best-model selection methods yielded similar results to MMI (a density-dependent model was favored in 66.2-93.9{\%} of species time series), while the hypothesis-testing methods detected density dependence less frequently (32.6-49.8{\%}). There were no obvious differences in the prevalence of density dependence across major taxonomic groups under any of the statistical methods used. These results underscore the value of using multiple modes of analysis to quantify the relative empirical support for a set of working hypotheses that encompass a range of realistic population dynamical behaviors.},

Nevertheless, the actual role of evolving plasticity in the responses of natural populations to climate change remains unresolved. Direct observations of evolutionary change in nature are rare, making it difficult to assess the relative contributions of changes in trait means versus changes in plasticity to climate change responses. To address this gap, this review explores several proxies that can be used to understand evolving plasticity in the context of climate change, including space for time substitutions, experimental evolution and tests for genomic divergence at environmentally responsive loci. Comparisons among populations indicate a prominent role for divergence in environmentally responsive traits in local adaptation to climatic gradients. Moreover, genomic comparisons among such populations have identified pervasive divergence in the regulatory regions...},

abstract = {This chapter describes various theoretical developments in the area of ecological and evolutionary processes, organizing and presenting them in a fashion that is chronological and is meant to illustrate the connections, similarities, and differences among them. Some background on theoretical ecology and theoretical evolutionary biology as independent fields of study is presented, and some examples that will illustrate various approaches have been introduced. There are many processes and types of interactions between organisms that have been the focus of ecological theory. A few of the most important include competition for resources, predation, parasitism, mutualism, and facilitation. Most recent techniques and approaches in theoretical evolutionary ecology do not represent a fundamental change in the way scientists are thinking about and modeling ecological-evolutionary feedbacks. Rather than being a paradigm shift, it represents "normal" science. What it truly fascinating, however, is that the work on single-locus models, quantitative-genetic models, game-theoretic models, and adaptive-dynamic models that have proceeded largely independent of one another, but have led to what is fundamentally the same mathematical description of evolutionary change. This suggests that there is something fundamental and robust being described by the different approaches because they have all converged on similar answers from different starting points. {\textcopyright} 2005 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is most commonly transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, caused by mutations in genes encoding cardiac sarcomere proteins. Other inheritable causes of the disease include mutations in genes coding for proteins important in calcium handling or that form part of the cytoskeleton. At present, the primary clinical role of genetic testing in HCM is to facilitate familial screening to allow the identification of individuals at risk of developing the disease. It is also used to diagnose genocopies, such as lysosomal and glycogen storage disease which have different treatment strategies, rates of disease progression and prognosis. The role of genetic testing in predicting prognosis is limited at present, but emerging data suggest that knowledge of the genetic basis of disease will assume an important role in disease stratification and offer potential targets for disease-modifying therapy in the near future.},

abstract = {A latitudinal gradient in biodiversity has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs, yet how and why this gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

abstract = {Lyssaviruses are bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses and the causative agents of the ancient zoonosis rabies. Africa is the likely home to the ancestors of taxa residing within the Genus Lyssavirus, Family Rhabdoviridae. Diverse lyssaviruses are envisioned as co-evolving with bats, as the ultimate reservoirs, over seemingly millions of years. In terms of relative distribution, overt abundance, and resulting progeny, rabies virus is the most successful lyssavirus species today, but for unknown reasons. All mammals are believed to be susceptible to rabies virus infection. Besides reservoirs among the Chiroptera, meso-carnivores also serve as major historical hosts and are represented among the canids, raccoons, skunks, mongooses, and ferret badgers. Perpetuating as a disease of nature with the mammalian central nervous system as niche, host breadth alone precludes any candidacy for true eradication. Despite having the highest case fatality of any infectious disease and a burden in excess of or comparative to other major zoonoses, rabies remains neglected. Once illness appears, no treatment is proven to prevent death. Paradoxically, vaccines were developed more than a century ago, but the clear majority of human cases are unvaccinated. Tens of millions of people are exposed to suspect rabid animals and tens of thousands succumb annually, primarily children in developing countries, where canine rabies is enzootic. Rather than culling animal populations, one of the most cost-effective strategies to curbing human fatalities is the mass vaccination of dogs. Building on considerable progress to date, several complementary actions are needed in the near future, including a more harmonized approach to viral taxonomy, enhanced de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance, focal pathogen discovery and characterization, applied pathobiological research for therapeutics, improved estimates of canine populations at risk, actual production of required vaccines and related biologics, strategies to maximize prevention but minimize unnecessary human prophylaxis, and a long-term, realistic plan for sustained global program support to achieve success in disease control, prevention, and elimination.},

abstract = {Physiological limits determine susceptibility to environmental changes, and can be assessed at the individual, population or species/lineage levels. Here I discuss these levels in Drosophila, and consider implications for determining species susceptibility to climate change. Limits at the individual level in Drosophila depend on experimental technique and on the context in which traits are evaluated. At the population level, evidence from selection experiments particularly involving Drosophila melanogaster indicate high levels of heritable variation and evolvability for coping with thermal stresses and aridity. An exception is resistance to high temperatures, which reaches a plateau in selection experiments and has a low heritability/evolvability when temperatures are ramped up to a stressful level. In tropical Drosophila species, populations are limited in their ability to evolve increased desiccation and cold resistance. Population limits can arise from trait and gene interactions but results from different laboratory studies are inconsistent and likely to underestimate the strength of interactions under field conditions. Species and lineage comparisons suggest phylogenetic conservatism for resistance to thermal extremes and other stresses. Plastic responses set individual limits but appear to evolve slowly in Drosophila. There is more species-level variation in lower thermal limits and desiccation resistance compared with upper limits, which might reflect different selection pressures and/or low evolvability. When extremes are considered, tropical Drosophila species do not appear more threatened than temperate species by higher temperatures associated with global warming, contrary to recent conjectures. However, species from the humid tropics may be threatened if they cannot adapt genetically to drier conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010, Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

Hydrostatic pressure is proposed to be one of the major environmental factors limiting the vertical distribution of extant marine invertebrates. However, the high-pressure acclimation mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Results: In this study, the shallow-water sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus was incubated at 15 and 25 MPa at 15 °C for 24 h, and subjected to comparative transcriptome analysis. Nine samples were sequenced and assembled into 553,507 unigenes with a N50 length of 1204 bp. Three groups of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified according to their gene expression patterns, including 38 linearly related DEGs whose expression patterns were linearly correlated with hydrostatic pressure, 244 pressure-sensitive DEGs which were up-regulated at both 15 and 25 MPa, and 257 high-pressure-induced DEGs which were up-regulated at 25 MPa but not up-regulated at 15 MPa. Conclusions: Our results indicated that the genes and biological processes involving high-pressure acclimation are similar to those related to deep-sea adaptation. In addition to representative biological processes involving deep-sea adaptation (such as antioxidation, immune response, genetic information processing, and DNA repair), two biological processes, namely, ubiquitination and endocytosis, which can collaborate with each other and regulate the elimination of misfolded proteins, also responded to high-pressure exposure in our study. The up-regulation of these two processes suggested that high hydrostatic pressure would lead to the increase of misfolded protein synthesis, and this may result in the death of shallow-water sea cucumber under high-pressure exposure.},

Here, we investigate seasonal plasticity and adaptive potential in an Afrotropical butterfly expressing distinct phenotypes in dry and wet seasons. We assess the transcriptional architecture of plasticity in a full-factorial analysis of heritable and environmental effects across 72 individuals, and reveal pervasive gene expression differences between the seasonal phenotypes. Strikingly, intra-population genetic variation for plasticity is largely absent, consistent with specialisation to a particular environmental cue reliably predicting seasonal transitions. Under climate change, deteriorating accuracy of predictive cues will likely aggravate maladaptive phenotype-environment mismatches and increase selective pressures on reaction norms. However, the observed paucity of genetic variation for plasticity limits evolutionary responses, potentially weakening prospects for population persistence. Thus, seasonally plastic species may be especially vulnerable to climate change.},

Previous research studying the effects of OA on the pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, has led this species to be identified as a sentinel organism for OA in polar oceans. Here, we present gene expression data on L. h. antarctica, collected in situ during the seasonal transition from early spring to early summer. Our findings suggest that after over-wintering under seasonal sea ice, pteropods progress toward full maturity in the early summer when food becomes increasingly available. This progression is highlighted by a dramatic shift in gene expression that supports the development of cytoskeletal structures, membrane ion transportation, and metabolically important enzymes associated with glycolysis. In addition, we observed signs of defense of genomic integrity and maturation as evidenced by an up-regulation of genes involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and gametogenesis. These data contribute to a broader understanding of the life-cycle dynamics for L. h. antarctica and provide key insights into the transcriptomic signals of pteropod maturation and growth during this key seasonal transition.},

Stress is a major aspect of natural selection in the wild, leading to changes in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes that are often triggered by one or a few transcription factors. In this work, we take advantage of the wealth of information available for Drosophila melanogaster and humans to analyze the role of transposable elements in six stress regulatory networks: immune, hypoxia, oxidative, xenobiotic, heat shock, and heavy metal. We found that transposable elements were enriched for caudal, dorsal, HSF, and tango binding sites in D. melanogaster and for NFE2L2 binding sites in humans. Taking into account the D. melanogaster population frequencies of transposable elements with predicted binding motifs and/or binding sites, we showed that those containing three or more binding motifs/sites are more likely to be functional. For a representative subset of these TEs, we performed in vivo transgenic reporter assays in different stress conditions. Overall, our results showed that TEs are relevant contributors to the transcriptional regulation of stress-response genes.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ectotherms are challenged by variation in both mean and variance of temperature. Phenotypic plasticity (thermal acclimation) might mitigate adverse effects, however, we lack a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thermal acclimation and how they are affected by fluctuating temperature. Here we investigated the effect of thermal acclimation in Drosophila melanogaster on critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and associated global gene expression profiles as induced by two constant and two ecologically relevant (non-stressful) diurnally fluctuating temperature regimes. Both mean and fluctuation of temperature contributed to thermal acclimation and affected the transcriptome. The transcriptomic response to mean temperatures comprised modification of a major part of the transcriptome, while the response to fluctuations affected a much smaller set of genes, which was highly independent of both the response to a change in mean temperature and to the classic heat shock response. Although the independent transcriptional effects caused by fluctuations were relatively small, they are likely to contribute to our understanding of thermal adaptation. We provide evidence that environmental sensing, particularly phototransduction, is a central mechanism underlying the regulation of thermal acclimation to fluctuating temperatures. Thus, genes and pathways involved in phototransduction are likely of importance in fluctuating climates.},

abstract = {Organisms may respond to changing environments through phenotypic plasticity or adaptive evolution. These two processes are not mutually exclusive and may either dampen or strengthen each other's effects, depending on the genetic correlation between trait values and the slopes of their norms of reaction. To examine the effect of adaptation to heat stress on the plasticity of heat tolerance, we hybridized populations of the crustacean Tigriopus californicus that show divergent phenotypes for heat tolerance. We then selected for increased heat tolerance in hybrids and measured heat tolerance and the phenotypic plasticity of heat tolerance in both selected lines and unselected controls. To test whether the changes in phenotypic plasticity were associated with changes in the plasticity of gene expression, we also sequenced transcriptomes of selected and unselected lines, both under heat shock and at ambient temperatures. We observed increased heat tolerance in selected lines, but also lower phenotypic and transcriptional plasticity in response to heat stress. The plastic response to heat stress was highly enriched for hydrolytic and catalytic activities, suggesting a prominent role for degradation of misfolded proteins. Our findings have important implications for biological responses to climate change: if adaptation to environmental stress reduces plasticity, then plasticity and adaptive evolution will make overlapping, rather than additive contributions to buffering populations from environmental change.},

abstract = {Cold tolerance is a key determinant of insect distribution and abundance, and thermal acclimation can strongly influence organismal stress tolerance phenotypes, particularly in small ectotherms like Drosophila. However, there is limited understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that confer such impressive plasticity. Here, we use high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to compare the transcriptomes and metabolomes of D. melanogaster acclimated as adults to warm (rearing) (21.5 °C) or cold conditions (6 °C). Cold acclimation improved cold tolerance and led to extensive biological reorganization: almost one third of the transcriptome and nearly half of the metabolome were differentially regulated. There was overlap in the metabolic pathways identified via transcriptomics and metabolomics, with proline and glutathione metabolism being the most strongly-supported metabolic pathways associated with increased cold tolerance. We discuss several new targets in the study of insect cold tolerance (e.g. dopamine signaling and Na + -driven transport), but many previously identified candidate genes and pathways (e.g. heat shock proteins, Ca 2+ signaling, and ROS detoxification) were also identified in the present study, and our results are thus consistent with and extend the current understanding of the mechanisms of insect chilling tolerance. Low temperature tolerance is a key determinant of insect distribution, because the physiological effects of temperature ultimately determine physical performance and reproductive success 1–4 . The extensive inter-and intra-specific variation in Drosophila thermal tolerance makes the genus a useful model for linking the effects of temperature on biochemistry and physiology to ecological patterns and processes 5–8 . Because of its cosmopoli-tan distribution in the wild, large degree of thermal tolerance plasticity 8–10 , and status as a model organism 11–13 , D. melanogaster Meigen is at the forefront of these investigations. Like many insects, Drosophila enter a state of paralysis termed chill coma at their critical thermal minimum (CT min) 14–17 . As chill-susceptible insects, adult flies lose ion and water balance during cold exposure, which eventually leads to cell death, tissue damage, physical performance deficits, and mortality 17–19 . However, if substantial injury has not yet occurred, flies recover the abil-ity to move when returned to favorable temperatures 20 . The response to cold in D. melanogaster is phenotypically plastic 6,9 , labile to artificial selection 21,22 , and segregates genetically 11 . Drosophila populations from higher lati-tudes are generally more cold-tolerant (defined as improvement in any cold tolerance trait) 23,24,26,27 , and there is a wealth of among-species variation in thermal tolerance within the Drosophila genus that persists when species are reared under common thermal conditions 5,25 . These evolved differences in cold tolerance appear, like phenotypic plasticity, to be partially driven by modifications in hemolymph ion and metabolite composition 5,18,28 , adaptive shifts in membrane composition that maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures 29,30 , and an ability to main-tain metabolic homeostasis in the face of chilling stress 31 . Surprisingly, in spite of this wealth of phenotypic information, the molecular mechanisms underlying cold tolerance of D. melanogaster are not fully understood, and relatively few candidate genes or pathways have been linked directly to chilling tolerance. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses of chill coma recovery time (CCRT) have only identified three QTLs associated with faster CCRT 12,32,33},

Phenotypic assays of chill coma recovery time (CCRT) together with previously published population genetic data suggest that only a small number of genes underlie improved cold hardiness in the cold-adapted populations. We used high-throughput RNA sequencing to analyze differential gene expression before and after exposure to a cold shock in coldtolerant lines (those with fast chill coma recovery, CCR) and cold-sensitive lines (slow CCR) from a population originating from Bangkok, Thailand (the ancestral species range). We identified two candidate genes with a significant interaction between cold tolerance and cold shock treatment: GF14647 and GF15058. Further, our data suggest that selection for increased cold tolerance did not operate through the increased activity of heat shock proteins, but more likely through the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton and a delayed onset of apoptosis.},

abstract = {Genetic predictions of height differ among human populations and these differences have been interpreted as evidence of polygenic adaptation. These differences were first detected using SNPs genome-wide significantly associated with height, and shown to grow stronger when large numbers of sub-significant SNPs were included, leading to excitement about the prospect of analyzing large fractions of the genome to detect polygenic adaptation for multiple traits. Previous studies of height have been based on SNP effect size measurements in the GIANT Consortium meta-analysis. Here we repeat the analyses in the UK Biobank, a much more homogeneously designed study. We show that polygenic adaptation signals based on large numbers of SNPs below genome-wide significance are extremely sensitive to biases due to uncorrected population stratification.

abstract = {In plants, local adaptation across species range is frequent. Yet, much has to be discovered on its environmental drivers, the underlying functional traits and their molecular determinants. Genome scans are popular to uncover outlier loci potentially involved in the genetic architecture of local adaptation, however links between outliers and phenotypic variation are rarely addressed. Here we focused on adaptation of teosinte populations along two elevation gradients in Mexico that display continuous environmental changes at a short geographical scale. We used two common gardens, and phenotyped 18 traits in 1664 plants from 11 populations of annual teosintes. In parallel, we genotyped these plants for 38 microsatellite markers as well as for 171 outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that displayed excess of allele differentiation between pairs of lowland and highland populations and/or correlation with environmental variables. Our results revealed that phenotypic differentiation at 10 out of the 18 traits was driven by local selection. Trait covariation along the elevation gradient indicated that adaptation to altitude results from the assembly of multiple co-adapted traits into a complex syndrome: as elevation increases, plants flower earlier, produce less tillers, display lower stomata density and carry larger, longer and heavier grains. The proportion of outlier SNPs associating with phenotypic variation, however, largely depended on whether we considered a neutral structure with 5 genetic groups (73.7{\%}) or 11 populations (13.5{\%}), indicating that population stratification greatly affected our results. Finally, chromosomal inversions were enriched for both SNPs whose allele frequencies shifted along elevation as well as phenotypically-associated SNPs. Altogether, our results are consistent with the establishment of an altitudinal syndrome promoted by local selective forces in teosinte populations in spite of detectable gene flow. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, SNPs that we found underlying phenotypic variation at adaptive traits may be relevant for future maize breeding.},

abstract = {Gene expression variation within species is relatively common, however, the role of natural selection in the maintenance of this variation is poorly understood. Here we investigate low and high latitude populations of Drosophila melanogaster and its sister species, D. simulans, to determine whether the two species show similar patterns of population differentiation, consistent with a role for spatially varying selection in maintaining gene expression variation. We compared at two temperatures the whole male transcriptome of D. melanogaster and D. simulans sampled from Panama City (Panama) and Maine (USA). We observed a significant excess of genes exhibiting differential expression in both species, consistent with parallel adaptation to heterogeneous environments. Moreover, the majority of genes showing parallel expression differentiation showed the same direction of differential expression in the two species and the magnitudes of expression differences between high and low latitude populations were correlated across species, further bolstering the conclusion that parallelism for expression phenotypes results from spatially varying selection. However, the species also exhibited important differences in expression phenotypes. For example, the genomic extent of genotype × environment interaction was much more common in D. melanogaster. Highly differentiated SNPs between low and high latitudes were enriched in the 3' UTRs and CDS of the geographically differently expressed genes in both species, consistent with an important role for cis-acting variants in driving local adaptation for expression-related phenotypes.},

abstract = {Norway spruce (Picea abies) is a dominant conifer species of major economic importance in northern Europe. Extensive breeding programs were established to improve phenotypic traits of economic interest. In southern Sweden, seeds used to create progeny tests were collected on about 3,000 trees of outstanding phenotype (‘plus' trees) across the region. In a companion paper, we showed that some were of local origin but many were recent introductions from the rest of the natural range. The mixed origin of the trees together with partial sequencing of the exome of {\textgreater}1,500 of these trees and phenotypic data retrieved from the Swedish breeding program offered a unique opportunity to dissect the genetic basis of local adaptation of three quantitative traits (height, diameter and bud-burst) and assess the potential of assisted gene flow. Through a combination of multivariate analyses and genome-wide association studies, we showed that there was a very strong effect of geographical origin on growth (height and diameter) and phenology (bud-burst) with trees from southern origins outperforming local provenances. Association studies revealed that growth traits were highly polygenic and bud-burst somewhat less. Hence, our results suggest that assisted gene flow and genomic selection approaches could help to alleviate the effect of climate change on P. abies breeding programs in Sweden.},

abstract = {Greenhouse studies have reported that maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal toxins may have nontarget effects on symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), however, field studies have not detected the same pattern. This may be due to the short-term nature of previous field experiments, differences in soil properties between studies, or plant-soil feedbacks that influence AMF communities in roots and soil over time. In this field experiment, we used split plots to evaluate the effect of Bt or non-s Bt maize cultivation history on AMF spore abundance, diversity, root colonization, and growth of seven different genotypes of Bt maize and five corresponding non- Bt parental (P) isolines. We found that Bt plants had higher leaf chlorophyll content when they were grown in plots that had been cultivated with Bt maize the previous year, and similarly, non- Bt plants had higher chlorophyll content when they were grown in plots with a non- Bt cultivation history, indicative of a positive feedback effect. There was a lower density of AMF spores in plots with a Bt maize cultivation history than in plots where P maize had been grown in the previous year, but no difference in spore diversity. Despite the differences in spore density, we found no significant differences in AMF colonization or root or shoot biomass between plots with a cultivation history of Bt and P maize. This study presents the first evidence of an effect of Bt maize cultivation on the soil ecosystem, but also provides further evidence that this effect is not necessarily large or easily detectable within the range of normal environmental variation. Management of agroecosystems will need to consider the potential effects of reduced numbers of AMF propagules in soil as this could have an effect on ecosystem processes including carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, drought tolerance, soil aggregation, and plant resistance to pathogens. Taken together with greenhouse experiments, we can now make predictions on how Bt maize cultivation may affect AMF under different environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Since microorganisms play a fundamental role in soil processes and plant growth, it is important to understand plant-microbe interactions, including how genetically modified (GM) plants can affect the soil microbial communities. This study aimed to investigate the diversity of the soil bacterial community associated with the root of GM drought-tolerant corn (Zea mays L.) bearing the gene encoding the transcription factor Hahb4 of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). Bacterial diversity was analyzed by amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in an experiment under controlled conditions using soil from two agricultural sites in Argentina (R{\'{i}}o Cuarto and In{\'{e}}s Indart) and two irrigation regimes (30{\%} and 100{\%} of soil field capacity). Results showed differences in microbial diversity between the two soils. However, under the conditions tested, the GM drought-tolerant corn line did not affect the $\alpha$ or $\beta$ diversity at the different irrigation regimes in comparison with the parental wild-type corn line. The main phyla composing the bacterial community were similar in both soils. Several genera were significantly more represented in the drought condition than in the condition with good irrigation. Drought had less effect on the bacterial diversity of In{\'{e}}s Indart soils than on that of R{\'{i}}o Cuarto soils. Results showed no undesirable impact of the GM drought-tolerant corn expressing the Hahb-4 gene on the rhizosphere bacterial community under the experimental conditions used in this study.},

ART, including in vitro fertilization (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection and preimplantation genetic testing, has resulted in the birth of more than 8 million children, and the pioneer of IVF, Professor Bob Edwards, was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize. The genetics revolution has resulted in our genomes being sequenced and many of the molecular mechanisms understood, and technologies for genomic editing have been developed. With the combination of nearly routine ART protocols for healthy conceptions together with almost error-free, inexpensive and simple methods for genetic modification, the question “Are we ready for genome editing in human embryos for clinical purposes?” was debated at the 5th congress on controversies in preconception, preimplantation and Prenatal Genetic Diagnosis, in collaboration with the Ovarian Club Meeting, in November 2018 in Paris. The co-authors each presented scientific, medical and bioethical backgrounds, and the debate was chaired by Professor Alan Handyside. In this paper, we consider whether genome editing is safe and ethical. We conclude that we are currently not ready for genome editing to be used in human embryos for clinical purposes, and we call for a global debate to determine if and when this technology could be used in ART. ‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬},

abstract = {Human herpesvirus-6A (HHV-6A) and 6B (HHV-6B) are two closely related betaherpesviruses that are associated with various diseases including seizures and encephalitis. The HHV-6A/B genomes have been shown to be present in an integrated state in the telomeres of latently infected cells. In addition, integration of HHV-6A/B in germ cells has resulted in individuals harboring this inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6A/B (iciHHV-6) in every cell of their body. Until now, the viral transcriptome and the epigenetic modifications that contribute to the silencing of the integrated virus genome remain elusive. In the current study, we used a patient-derived iciHHV-6A cell line to assess the global viral gene expression profile by RNA-seq, and the chromatin profiles by MNase-seq and ChIP-seq analyses. In addition, we investigated an in vitro generated cell line (293-HHV-6A) that expresses GFP upon the addition of agents commonly used to induce herpesvirus reactivation such as TPA. No viral gene expression including miRNAs was detected from the HHV-6A genomes, indicating that the integrated virus is transcriptionally silent. Intriguingly, upon stimulation of the 293- HHV-6A cell line with TPA, only foreign promoters in the virus genome were activated, while all HHV-6A promoters remained completely silenced. The transcriptional silencing of latent HHV-6A was further supported by MNase-seq results, which demonstrate that the latent viral genome resides in a highly condensed nucleosome-associated state. We further explored the enrichment profiles of histone modifications via ChIP-seq analysis. Our results indicated that the HHV-6 genome is modestly enriched with the repressive histone marks H3K9me3/H3K27me3 and does not possess the active histone modifications H3K27ac/H3K4me3. Overall, these results indicate that HHV-6 genomes reside in a condensed chromatin state, providing insight into the epigenetic mechanisms associated with the silencing of the integrated HHV-6A genome.},

abstract = {Transcriptome analysis may provide means to investigate the underlying genetic causes of shared and divergent phenotypes in different populations and help to identify potential targets of adaptive evolution. Applying RNA sequencing to whole male Drosophila melanogaster from the ancestral tropical African environment and a very recently colonized cold-temperate European environment at both standard laboratory conditions and following a cold shock, we seek to uncover the transcriptional basis of cold adaptation. In both the ancestral and the derived populations, the predominant characteristic of the cold shock response is the swift and massive upregulation of heat shock proteins and other chaperones. Although we find {\~{}}25 {\%} of the genome to be differentially expressed following a cold shock, only relatively few genes (n = 16) are up- or down-regulated in a population-specific way. Intriguingly, 14 of these 16 genes show a greater degree of differential expression in the African population. Likewise, there is an excess of genes with particularly strong cold-induced changes in expression in Africa on a genome-wide scale. The analysis of the transcriptional cold shock response most prominently reveals an upregulation of components of a general stress response, which is conserved over many taxa and triggered by a plethora of stressors. Despite the overall response being fairly similar in both populations, there is a definite excess of genes with a strong cold-induced fold-change in Africa. This is consistent with a detrimental deregulation or an overshooting stress response. Thus, the canalization of European gene expression might be responsible for the increased cold tolerance of European flies.},

While stressful environmental conditions are normally viewed as a strong selective force, they can also impact directly on the genetic basis of traits such as through environment-dependent gene action. Here, we used the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel to investigate the impact of developmental temperature on variance components and evolutionary potential of cold tolerance. We reared 166 lines at five temperatures and assessed cold tolerance of adult male flies from each line and environment. We show (1) that the expression of genetic variation for cold tolerance is highly dependent on developmental temperature, (2) that the genetic correlation of cold tolerance between environments decreases as developmental temperatures become more distinct, (3) that the correlation between cold tolerance at individual developmental temperatures and plasticity for cold tolerance differs across developmental temperatures, and even switches sign across the thermal developmental gradient, and (4) that evolvability decrease with increasing developmental temperatures. Our results show that the quantitative genetic basis of low temperature tolerance is environment specific. This conclusion is important for the understanding of evolution in variable thermal environments and for designing experiments aimed at pinpointing candidate genes and performing functional analyses of thermal resistance.},

abstract = {Across several animal taxa, the evolution of sociality involves a suite of characteristics, a “social syndrome,” that includes cooperative breeding, reproductive skew, primary female-biased sex ratio, and the transition from outcrossing to inbreeding mating system, factors that are expected to reduce effective population size (Ne). This social syndrome may be favoured by short-term benefits but come with long-term costs, because the reduction in Ne amplifies loss of genetic diversity by genetic drift, ultimately restricting the potential of populations to respond to environmental change. To investigate the consequences of this social life form on genetic diversity, we used a comparative RAD-sequencing approach to estimate genomewide diversity in spider species that differ in level of sociality, reproductive skew and mating system. We analysed multiple populations of three independent sister-species pairs of social inbreeding and subsocial outcrossing Stegodyphus spiders, and a subsocial outgroup. Heterozygosity and within-population diversity were sixfold to 10-fold lower in social compared to subsocial species, and demographic modelling revealed a tenfold reduction in Ne of social populations. Species-wide genetic diversity depends on population divergence and the viability of genetic lineages. Population genomic patterns were consistent with high lineage turnover, which homogenizes the genetic structure that builds up between inbreeding populations, ultimately depleting genetic diversity at the species level. Indeed, species-wide genetic diversity of social species was 5–8 times lower than that of subsocial species. The repeated evolution of species with this social syndrome is associated with severe loss of genomewide diversity, likely to limit their evolutionary potential.},

abstract = {Many species have experienced dramatic changes in their abundance and distribution during recent climate change, but it is often unclear whether such ecological responses are accompanied by evolutionary change. We used targeted exon sequencing of 294 museum specimens (160 historic, 134 modern) to generate independent temporal genomic contrasts spanning a century of climate change (1911–2012) for two co-distributed chipmunk species: an endemic alpine specialist (Tamias alpinus) undergoing severe range contraction and a stable mid-elevation species (T. speciosus). Using a novel analytical approach, we reconstructed the demographic histories of these populations and tested for evidence of recent positive directional selection. Only the retracting species showed substantial population genetic fragmentation through time and this was coupled with positive selection and substantial shifts in allele frequencies at a gene, Alox15, involved in regulation of inflammation and response to hypoxia. However, these rapid population and gene-level responses were not detected in an analogous temporal contrast from another area where T. alpinus has also undergone severe range contraction. Collectively, these results highlight that evolutionary responses may be variable and context dependent across populations, even when they show seemingly synchronous ecological shifts. Our results demonstrate that temporal genomic contrasts can be used to detect very recent evolutionary responses within and among contemporary populations, even in the face of complex demographic changes. Given the wealth of specimens archived in natural history museums, comparative analyses of temporal population genomic data have the potential to improve our understanding of recent and ongoing evolutionary responses to rapidly changing environments.},

abstract = {Background: Organisms can rapidly adapt to their environment when colonizing a new habitat, and this could occur by changing protein sequences or by altering patterns of gene expression. The importance of gene expression in driving local adaptation is increasingly being appreciated, and cis-regulatory elements (CREs), which control and modify the expression of the nearby genes, are predicted to play an important role. Here we investigate genetic variation in gene expression in immune-challenged Drosophila melanogaster from temperate and tropical or sub-tropical populations in Australia and United States. Results: We find parallel latitudinal changes in gene expression, with genes involved in immunity, insecticide resistance, reproduction, and the response to the environment being especially likely to differ between latitudes. By measuring allele-specific gene expression (ASE), we show that cis-regulatory variation also shows parallel latitudinal differences between the two continents and contributes to the latitudinal differences in gene expression. Conclusions: Both Australia and United States were relatively recently colonized by D. melanogaster, and it was recently shown that introductions of both African and European flies occurred, with African genotypes contributing disproportionately to tropical populations. Therefore, both the demographic history of the populations and local adaptation may be causing the patterns that we see.},

abstract = {Reference collections of multiple Drosophila lines with accumulating collections of "omics" data have proven especially valuable for the study of population genetics and complex trait genetics. Here we present a description of a resource collection of 84 strains of Drosophila melanogaster whose genome sequences were obtained after 12 generations of full-sib inbreeding. The initial rationale for this resource was to foster development of a systems biology platform for modeling metabolic regulation by the use of natural polymorphisms as perturbations. As reference lines, they are amenable to repeated phenotypic measurements, and already a large collection of metabolic traits have been assayed. Another key feature of these strains is their widespread geographic origin, coming from Beijing, Ithaca, Netherlands, Tasmania, and Zimbabwe. After obtaining 12.5× coverage of paired-end Illumina sequence reads, SNP and indel calls were made with the GATK platform. Thorough quality control was enabled by deep sequencing one line to {\textgreater} 100×, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms and indels were validated using ddRAD-sequencing as an orthogonal platform. In addition, a series of preliminary population genetic tests were performed with these single-nucleotide polymorphism data for assessment of data quality. We found 83 segregating inversions among the lines, and as expected these were especially abundant in the African sample. We anticipate that this will make a useful addition to the set of reference D. melanogaster strains, thanks to its geographic structuring and unusually high level of genetic diversity.},

abstract = {The regulatory architecture of gene expression remains an area of active research. Here, we studied how the interplay of genetic and environmental variation affects gene expression by exposing Drosophila melanogaster strains to four different developmental temperatures. At 18°C we observed almost complete canalization with only very few allelic effects on gene expression. In contrast, at the two temperature extremes, 13°C and 29°C a large number of allelic differences in gene expression were detected due to both cis- and trans-regulatory effects. Allelic differences in gene expression were mainly dominant, but for up to 62{\%} of the genes the dominance swapped between 13 and 29°C. Our results are consistent with stabilizing selection causing buffering of allelic expression variation in non-stressful environments. We propose that decanalization of gene expression in stressful environments is not only central to adaptation, but may also contribute to genetic disorders in human populations.},

abstract = {Understanding how DNA sequence variation is translated into variation for complex phenotypes has remained elusive but is essential for predicting adaptive evolution, for selecting agriculturally important animals and crops, and for personalized medicine. Gene expression may provide a link between variation in DNA sequence and organismal phenotypes, and its abundance can be measured efficiently and accurately. Here we quantified genome-wide variation in gene expression in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), increasing the annotated Drosophila transcriptome by 11{\%}, including thousands of novel transcribed regions (NTRs). We found that 42{\%} of the Drosophila transcriptome is genetically variable in males and females, including the NTRs, and is organized into modules of genetically correlated transcripts. We found that NTRs often were negatively correlated with the expression of protein-coding genes, which we exploited to annotate NTRs functionally. We identified regulatory variants for the mean and variance of gene expression, which have largely independent genetic control. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for the mean, but not for the variance, of gene expression were concentrated near genes. Notably, the variance eQTLs often interacted epistatically with local variants in these genes to regulate gene expression. This comprehensive characterization of population-scale diversity of transcriptomes and its genetic basis in the DGRP is critically important for a systems understanding of quantitative trait variation.},

abstract = {Skeletal muscle myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) is a myosin thick filament-associated protein, localized through its C terminus to distinct regions (C-zones) of the sarcomere. MyBP-C modulates muscle contractility, presumably through its N terminus extending from the thick filament and interacting with either the myosin head region and/or the actin thin filament. Two isoforms of MyBP- C (fast- and slow-type) are expressed in a muscle type-specific manner. Are the expression, localization, and Ca2+-dependent modulatory capacities of these isoforms different in fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow-twitch soleus (SOL) muscles derived from Sprague–Dawley rats? By mass spectrome- try, 4 MyBP-C isoforms (1 fast-type MyBP-C and 3 N-terminally spliced slow-type MyBP-C) were expressed in EDL, but only the 3 slow-type MyBP-C isoforms in SOL. Using EDL and SOL native thick filaments in which the MyBP-C stoichiometry and localization are preserved, native thin filament sliding over these thick fila- ments showed that, only in the C-zone, MyBP-C Ca2+ sensitizes the thin filament and slows thin filament velocity. These modula- tory properties depended on MyBP-C's N terminus as N-terminal proteolysis attenuated MyBP-C's functional capacities. To deter- mine each MyBP-C isoform's contribution to thin filament Ca2+ sensitization and slowing in the C-zone, we used a combination of in vitro motility assays using expressed recombinant N-terminal fragments and in silico mechanistic modeling. Our results suggest that each skeletal MyBP-C isoform's N terminus is functionally dis- tinct and has modulatory capacities that depend on the muscle type in which they are expressed, providing the potential for mo- lecular tuning of skeletal muscle performance through differential MyBP-C expression.},

abstract = {In many species, genomic data have revealed pervasive adaptive evolution indicated by the fixation of beneficial alleles. However, when selection pressures are highly variable along a species' range or through time adaptive alleles may persist at intermediate frequencies for long periods. So called “balanced polymorphisms” have long been understood to be an important component of standing genetic variation, yet direct evidence of the strength of balancing selection and the stability and prevalence of balanced polymorphisms has remained elusive. We hypothesized that environmental fluctuations among seasons in a North American orchard would impose temporally variable selection on Drosophila melanogaster that would drive repeatable adaptive oscillations at balanced polymorphisms. We identified hundreds of polymorphisms whose frequency oscillates among seasons and argue that these loci are subject to strong, temporally variable selection. We show that these polymorphisms respond to acute and persistent changes in climate and are associated in predictable ways with seasonally variable phenotypes. In addition, our results suggest that adaptively oscillating polymorphisms are likely millions of years old, with some possibly predating the divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model of balancing selection wherein rapid temporal fluctuations in climate over generational time promotes adaptive genetic diversity at loci underlying polygenic variation in fitness related phenotypes.},

abstract = {Most natural populations are affected by seasonal changes in temperature, rainfall, or resource availability. Seasonally fluctuating selection could potentially make a large contribution to maintaining genetic polymorphism in populations. However, previous theory suggests that the conditions for multilocus polymorphism are restrictive. Here, we explore a more general class of models with multilocus seasonally fluctuating selection in diploids. In these models, the multilocus genotype is mapped to fitness in two steps. The first mapping is additive across loci and accounts for the relative contributions of heterozygous and homozygous loci—that is, dominance. The second step uses a nonlinear fitness function to account for the strength of selection and epistasis. Using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations, we show that stable polymorphism at many loci is possible if currently favored alleles are sufficiently dominant. This general mechanism, which we call “segregation lift,” requires seasonal changes in dominance, a phenomenon that may arise naturally in situations with antagonistic pleiotropy and seasonal changes in the relative importance of traits for fitness. Segregation lift works best under diminishing-returns epistasis, is not affected by problems of genetic load, and is robust to differences in parameters across loci and seasons. Under segregation lift, loci can exhibit conspicuous seasonal allele-frequency fluctuations, but often fluctuations may be small and hard to detect. An important direction for future work is to formally test for segregation lift in empirical data and to quantify its contribution to maintaining genetic variation in natural populations.},

abstract = {From May to December 1997, 18 cases of mild to severe respiratory illness caused by avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses were identified in Hong Kong. The emergence of an avian virus in the human population prompted an epidemiological investigation to determine the extent of human-to-human transmission of the virus and risk factors associated with infection. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, the standard method for serologic detection of influenza virus infection in humans, has been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of antibodies induced by avian influenza viruses. Therefore, we developed a more sensitive microneutralization assay to detect antibodies to avian influenza in humans. Direct comparison of an HI assay and the microneutralization assay demonstrated that the latter was substantially more sensitive in detecting human antibodies to H5N1 virus in infected individuals. An H5-specific indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was also established to test children's sera. The sensitivity and specificity of the microneutralization assay were compared with those of an H5-specific indirect ELISA. When combined with a confirmatory H5-specific Western blot test, the specificities of both assays were improved. Maximum sensitivity (80{\%}) and specificity (96{\%}) for the detection of anti-H5 antibody in adults aged 18 to 59 years were achieved by using the microneutralization assay combined with Western blotting. Maximum sensitivity (100{\%}) and specificity (100{\%}) in detecting anti-H5 antibody in sera obtained from children less than 15 years of age were achieved by using ELISA combined with Western blotting. This new test algorithm is being used for the seroepidemiologic investigations of the avian H5N1 influenza outbreak.},

Previous research has shown that partitioning an evolving population into age groups can greatly improve the ability to identify global optima and avoid converging to local optima. Here, we propose that treating age as an explicit optimization criterion can increase performance even further, with fewer algorithm implementation parameters. The proposed method evolves a population on the two-dimensional Pareto front comprising (a) how long the genotype has been in the population (age); and (b) its performance (fitness). We compare this approach with previous approaches on the Symbolic Regression problem, sweeping the problem difficulty over a range of solution complexities and number of variables. Our results indicate that the multi-objective approach identifies the exact target solution more often that the age-layered population and standard population methods. The multi-objective method also performs better on higher complexity problems and higher dimensional datasets -finding global optima with less computational effort.},

abstract = {To reduce the problem of premature convergence we define a new method for measuring an individual's age and propose the Age-Layered Population Structure (ALPS). This new measure of age measures how long the genetic material has been evolving in the population: offspring start with an age of 1 plus the age of their oldest parent instead of starting with an age of 0 as with traditional measures of age. ALPS differs from a typical evolutionary algorithm (EA) by segregating individuals into different age-layers by their age and by regularly introducing new, randomly generated individuals in the youngest layer. The introduction of randomly generated individuals at regular intervals results in an EA that is never completely converged and is always exploring new parts of the fitness landscape. By using age to restrict competition and breeding, younger individuals are able to develop without being dominated by older ones. Analysis of the search behavior of ALPS finds that the offspring of individuals that are randomly generated mid-way through a run are able to move the population out of mediocre local-optima to better parts of the fitness landscape. In comparison against a traditional EA, a multi-start EA and two other EAs with diversity maintenance schemes we find that ALPS produces significantly better designs with a higher reliability than the other EAs.},

abstract = {Rationale: Truncation mutations in the MYBPC3 gene, encoding for cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C), are the leading cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Whole heart, fiber and molecular studies demonstrate that MyBP-C is a potent modulator of cardiac contractility, but how these mutations contribute to HCM is unresolved. Objectives: To readdress whether MYBPC3 truncation mutations result in loss of MyBP-C content and/or the expression of truncated MyBP-C from the mutant allele and determine how these mutations effect myofilament sliding in human myocardium. Methods and results: Septal wall tissue samples were obtained from HCM patients undergoing myectomy (n = 18) and donor controls (n = 8). The HCM samples contained 40{\%} less MyBP-C and reduced levels of MyBP-C phosphorylation, when compared to the donor control samples using quantitative mass spectrometry. These differences occurred in the absence of changes in the stoichiometry of other myofilament proteins or production of truncated MyBP-C from the mutant MYBPC3 allele. The functional impact of MYBPC3 truncation mutations on myofilament sliding was determined using a total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM) single particle assay. Myosin-thick filaments containing their native complement of MyBP-C, and actin-thin filaments decorated with the troponin/tropomyosin calcium regulatory proteins, were isolated from a subgroup of the HCM (n = 4) and donor (n = 5) heart samples. The maximal sliding velocity of native thin filaments was enhanced within the C-zones of the native thick filaments isolated from the HCM samples, when compared to velocity within the C-zones of thick filaments isolated from the donor samples. Analytical modeling demonstrated that the 40{\%} reduction in MyBP-C content was sufficient to enhance the myofilament sliding velocity, as observed in the TIRFM assay. Conclusions: HCM-causing MYBPC3 truncation mutations result in a loss of MyBP-C content that enhances maximal myofilament sliding velocities, only where MyBP-C is localized within the C-zone. These findings support therapeutic rationale for restoring normal levels of MyBP-C and/or dampening maximal contractile velocities for the treatment of human HCM.},
